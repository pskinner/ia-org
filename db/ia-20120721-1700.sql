Aesthetically it looks like a factory but was designed for the public to play around and engage with the architecture. It was an improvisational architecture in which common citizens could entertain and educate themselves by assembling their own environments using cranes and prefabricated modules. &#8220;Choose what you want to do - or watch someone else doing it.

In the installation, visitors wear special see-through data glasses, which register and superimpose 3D graphics into the real world. When one of the users speaks or sings, colorful abstract forms appear to emerge from his or her mouth. The graphics representing these utterances assume a wide variety of shapes and behaviors that are tightly coupled to the unique qualities of the vocalist’s volume, pitch and timbre.

Creating Laminar airflows involves running air through a number of meshes that become finer and finer regulating the air until it flows in a relatively straight direction. In the case of Fogscreen the direction is down so to make this more effective have a lower air pressure device such as fans underneath sucking the air away. The Fog Screen project doesn''t do this because its designed to be used anywhere but in reality it would be enhanced by a device pulling the air.\n\nI know that doesnt expand very much on the pretty poor explanation they give on the fogscreen''s website but If you want to know more the key is in the laminar airflow and there''s a lot of information available about engineering in laminar airflows but its pretty dry.  Making the mist is quite easy but I''ve been warned by a friend that ultrasonic devices can really hurt if you put your hand in the water when they''re turning it to mist.\n\nhope that helps a little,  i''m actually doing an immaterial architecture project at the moment using laminar airflows but its in its very early stages so perhaps I might have some more details in the near future.\n\ncheers\n\nRuairi', 0, '1', '', '', 0, 0),

She engages with space by creating solid-state ferrofluid sculptures through the introduction of electro-magnetic fields to the fluid. Ferrofluid is a very interesting material originally developed by NASA it has now found itself been used for a whole range of devices including liquid seals around the spinning drive shafts in hard disks, liquid coolants in loudspeakers, or dampers for controlling and stabilizing large building that move around in the wind. Whats also amazing is that they have such lovely visual qualities when magnetized. When ferrofluid is subjected to a sufficiently strong vertical magnetic field, the surface spontaneously forms a regular pattern of corrugations. Kodama uses this effect in quite a spectacular way (see images below), not just by applying magnetic fields but also changing them through the introduction of sounds (e.g. by clapping her hands or singing); through these sounds for example, emotions can directly change space.

But much work is being done on developing exotic materials, and it seems to me that it may be possible to create a fabric that dramatically stiffens when electrified. Using something like this, it may be possible to inflate a more or less rigid structure on the ground, pump a portion of the internal air out, getting lift bouyancy, pumping more out as the structure rises, until the whole interior is a near vacuum. Once near space, deflate the "gas bag" portion of the airship, and rocket the last little way into space.\n\nIn this way, it might be possible to get from here to there in one vehicle.', 0, '1', '', '', 0, 0),

This model is like a three-dimensional version of the two- dimensional light-bulb-matrix billbooards on Broadway-and-Forty-Second Street, New York City. The billboards have fields of powerful little light bulbs which are switched off-and-on by remote controllers, varying their intensity and color.\n\nOur atomic model would display each and every atom in its naturally occuring arrangement. We could light a group of atoms to represent our own body. By turning on all the right lights at the right time, we could model "you," with your organically arranged "body" of lights surrounding "you" in every direction, moving through space in any direction.\n\nWith accurate timing, we could activate the same number of lights in the same pattern, and achieve the optical effect (as with two-dimensional, flat movies), by successively activating each of the lights from one voxel to the next, with small, local "movement" variations of "you" accomplished by special local matrix sequence programmings.\n\nWe could progressively and discretely activate each of the atoms of such a matrix to become "lights," and could move an arbitrary "form" through the field. The form could be a "sphere," a "polyhedron," or any other shape including complex ones such as you or me. This three-dimensional group of points can be programmed multidimensionally on a computer in such a manner that a concentric spherical cluster of "light" points can be progressively "turned on" to comprise a "substance" which seemingly moves from here to there.  </blockquote>', 0, '1', '', '', 0, 0),

When relieving yourself into this interactive urinal, you launch a mini-game that focuses on a target, with your stream acting as the input device. By targeting a specific area, you are prompted to control a character or object on the screen. In addition, the benefit of this interactive urinal is that people now really focus on hitting the urinal and not outside, as Neundörfer explains:  The reduced size of the “target” improves restroom hygiene and saves on cleanings costs (like the “fly in the urinal” at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport). It also makes a trip to the urinal “fun and games” – more than just a necessary nuisance.  We now wonder why Nintendo spent so much money on designing a freehand controller when every man already has a revolutionary controller.

You''re growing a complex behaviour in a petri dish and he''s taking one apart to see how it works.\n\nI understand where you''re coming from on the lack of understanding of the brain, A lot of work is theory, and they remain theoretical until they can be tested\n\nBut we don''t need to have a complete understanding of the brain before the information of what we do know becomes relevant.  The moon landings were done with what we now consider to be very simple science.\n\nSomewhere between an interactive environment and ''us'' is our brains so it definetly plays a part at some point.   Interacting with something is a dialogue, it is a two way event, or a communication.  We can only have a dialogue with something through some kind of language; moving your body through the room, facial expressions, making sounds or whatever else it may be.  There is a transition of information between someone and the thing they are interacting with.  Some kind of bridge between the mental internal world of experience and the reality that actually surrounds us.  It''s like a land bridge between two subject areas!\n\nWe may not have succeeded in getting AI-like results from remodelling our understanding of the brain.  But we can still produce highly engaging and meaningful interactive surroundings by applying our models of the brain to them.  As a survival mechanism in intelligent forms of life, most animals have intention.  Normally this is, procreating, or eating.  Intention is in-built, or is learnt and is normally enforced by reward for doing well and punishment for doing something wrong.

I have tackled all the design challenges myself both design and construction as well as behaviours and learning algorithms.\n\nSo to credit some of the platforms on which this was made. I used the OpenCV library for Facial recognition. The Genetic Algorithm was based on looking at some flow diagrams given to me by Sean Hanna, a research at the Bartlett who I wrote about recently on my blog. The GA was implemented in Processing and the OpenCV library was implemented in MaxMSP using jit.CV. The robotics were controlled by Arduino I/O boards. Regarding papers, if anything I think Gordon Pask''s ''A Comment, A Case History and a Plan'' was the only piece of text that really had a major impact on this installation and that was not in a technical sense.

The space between where the interface is constructed that enables us to share information and evolve our understandings and dialog over time. I think this bridging ground is whats necessary for interaction and unless both sides are able to improvise and negotiate, the middle ground gets lost as one assumes control of the other. In 99.9% of Human Computer Interaction, this is where the human becomes dictator over a series of predefined behaviours.\n\nRegarding simple animal behaviour, I think Rodney Brooks'' observations of behaviour in the field of mobile robotics are illuminating and I can''t stress how interesting they are to read for not just scientists but artists as well.

I''m hoping to use your site for a class I will be co-teaching at University of Michigan in Fall 2009. ‘Smartsurfaces’ will offer a project-based learning experience in which artists, designers, architects and engineers can come together to explore new possibilities for creating spaces that interact with the people who use them. The course will seek to create a multidisciplinary community of interest around the exploration of structural systems and surfaces augmented by networked computing elements that have the capability to learn and to adapt to new information and conditions. We will link information systems with physical form to produce dynamically variable, tactile ‘informatic’ or ‘smart’ surfaces. The course provides the framework for the development of new projects, fuelled by discourse between the three Schools of Art &amp; Design; Architecture and Urban Planning; and Engineering. The course will be co-taught by 3 Professors: Karl Daubmann (of PLY Architecture); Max Shtein and me.\n\nCheers,\nJohn Marshall.', 0, '1', '', '', 0, 0),

Metaphoric axioms improve AI’s and architecture’s interactions by likening it to architecture. As AI architecture, the “strange” of AI becomes linked to the “familiar” architecture and the two can be compared: AI and architecture, they both can benefit from a metaphoric vocabulary.  As most AI/IT activities, they work through digital and mechanical devices, mainframes, hard drives, processors, motherboards and chips, as well as application software, firmware, middleware, (which controls and co-ordinates distributed systems) , and system software (such as operating systems) , which interface with hardware to provide the necessary services for application software, these are all the body to the brain of AI.  To warrant my claim as other disciplines these bodies are driven by some form of axioms (structured vocabulary) however, about AI architectural work, there is presently little in the way of axioms.\nHistorically, in the early eighties, Silicone Valley data companies (I consulted such companies in Sunnyvale between 1979 and 1981) scoured the market for soft information to build proposed programs for computer aided design (CAD) intended to be driven by design professionals to actually lay down graphic images instead of hand drafted (pencil on paper) drawings.  Having put traditional draftsman out of the loop, and, developed “master specs” for computerized specifications, the next step is now to reduce the expense of design personal and extend the design capability and capacity.\nThirty years later the design industry claims that what can be done for the design of manufacturing plants, machine parts and assemblies may be applicable to creating communities, environments, developments and specific buildings.\nThe resolution’s presumed context is that it is not just limited to information technology (IT) but a presumption of intelligence assuming man can make something which can think for itself as today’s computer games, medical procedures, aircraft and military devices The below examples show that when programmed, systems can make judgments in a strange environment and metaphorically make the strange familiar (metaphorically) and systematically design buildings.  (Where design is intentionally originating and developing a plan for a product, structure, system, or component). The impact of artificial intelligence on the future of architecture: practice, process and products are that today there are “smart buildings” with internal mechanical and electrical systems that respond to the specific behavioral patterns of occupants.\nBelow you will find potentials for the use of metaphoric architectural axioms where artificial intelligence examples have been applied to designing buildings without necessarily acting as an “architect”, where design is only one architectural function.   No more than would we have diagnostic equipment and robotics perform sovereign surgery on a doctor’s patient. Currently all other systems use protocols, parameters and axiomatic frameworks, axioms and guidelines needed to facilitate artificial diagnostics, analysis, and design of buildings at one or another level is the impact of  artificial intelligence on the future of architecture.\n\nTo complete the case for the resolution that AI’s and architecture’s mutual interactions will be improved and managed risks [ff] by metaphoric axioms I have provided a short summary of the claims and examples a of the 83 axioms I have authored in another much longer monograph [T].\nLeaving those details of all the axioms for another essay suffice it to say that these axioms are essential drivers of AI architectural activities.\nAs a predicate this AI system can be used by the architectural profession to expand its use of metaphors and services to manage the design process by interfacing with clients, society, culture, contactors and building authorities and finally selecting the appropriate axioms and managing the overall design process [aa]. These architectural metaphoric axioms will have an impact on the future of AI and building architecture.  Since a host for the architectural metaphoric axioms is needed I warrant my inference that even today’s architectural practice has changed, communicating between many disciplines via the internet. “The availability of reliable, high-speed electronic connectivity enabled collaborative design team’s function irrespective of physical distance. [V] This calls for  new type of design and simulation environment—one that facilitates automated searching and locating of satisfying and optimizing parts, integration of selected parts in an assembly, and simulation of the overall design that is distributed over the Internet”.\nAn increasing quantity of building applications of AI work is based on [W] “Building Information Modeling (BIM) generating and managing building data during its life cycle”.\nAI neither promises uncontrolled sovereign operations, inventions, creativity, and innovative design but instead it promises to operate within the parameters and limits designed by man and if it could innovate, invent and create it would only do so with either specific geometry or geometric axioms. However said, Science fiction writers extrapolate the potential of AI beings aimed at ultimately destroying their creators. This metaphor to Frankenstein is to our culture as intimidating as is other unsavory results of cloning.  Examples to the inferences where already industrial design for automobiles, aircraft and boats use design applications to meet aerodynamic, seismic, wind, structural loads, etc. These already account for the strength of materials, if given, or can optimally select materials based on its library of manufactured products. In addition [U] virtual building environments (VBE) are now producing graphic scenarios to estimate, plan, buy and build; already artificial intelligence is having an impact of on the future of architecture\nExamples and concerns applying AI to building design.\nWithout concerns for risks the practical and the esoteric applications of AI to the built environment is often the result of metaphoric inventive processes, shocks and imaginative invention such as [M] ANTS which is an innovative example of an AI application to design buildings. “The Autonomic Nanotechnology Swarm (ANTS) is a generic mission architecture consisting of miniaturized, autonomous, self-similar, reconfigurable, addressable components forming structures. The components/structures have wide spatial distribution and multi-level organization. This ‘swarm’ (metaphor) behavior is inspired (metaphoric association) by the success of social insect colonies where within their specialties, individuals outperform generalists and with sufficiently efficient social interaction and coordination, groups of specialists outperform groups of generalists. [M] (Multi-disciplinary)\nAxiomatically, the type of information that is preserved in the traditional built environment is organized-complexity: precisely the type of information that defines living systems themselves. Thus, the traditional built environment consists of evolved and discovered solutions (schemata) that make our life easier and more meaningful” [N].\nThat having been said as ACTS combines design and construction “Research in construction automation at the University of Reading led to the formulation of a computer-integrated, component-based construction system. [Q}\nThe Reading Building System was rationalized for automation following a systematic study of the construction processes involved in the design and erection of a variety of building types, especially high-tech offices. Computer-aided design (CAD) packages were written that used Parts Set components as primitives and that offered flexibility in design that was so often lacking in earlier approaches to system building. At the same time, a family of automation aids was developed to manipulate the parts that were modeled in the CAD\nIn the Netherlands [S] “Artificial Design focuses on the application in architecture and design of the algorithmic approach to art being developed at the Institute of Artificial Art Amsterdam.  Once a style has been defined the tool can suggest any desired number of alternative designs for a given document.  The Department of Artificial Architecture develops programs which generate random specifications of 3-dimensional objects. Each of these programs employs a "visual grammar" to define an infinite set of structures, and then draws random samples from this space”.\n “The science of design usually conceives of AI as a set of tools for structuring the process, or planning, or optimizing. [R] This further warrants that “ Rarely does the computer explore a space of designs, and in doing so, it is generally following a set of precise rules, so the machine is doing little else than repeating a series of mechanical steps, faster than a human could. Creativity is usually considered to lie outside the realm of what computers can do”. Evolutionary Design (ED), the creation of designs by computers using evolutionary methods is a new research area with an enormous potential”.\nTo manage some of the risk [ff]  using existing metaphoric architectural axioms manufactured buildings, pre-engineered steel buildings, mobile homes, decks, kitchens, lighting, structures which are just some of the examples of pre-designed programs  allows user to input variables to receive a design result.  There are both similarities and differences between human natural intelligence and artificial intelligence which are metaphorically associated with the concerns of people and their aspirations to shape the post-industrial society. Metaphorical fears that people and not machines shape society adopted from the critics of the industrial and information revolution. In a way this is risk mitigation by reducing adopting metaphors that make the strange familiar and limit the unknowns.\nHowever, on closer examination, reality and fiction are different since artificial intelligence is authored by humans (the imagined fear is that what was created by man could turn against man when the AI capability to design, redesign and rebuild goes awry). Especially in building design, I argue that since there is a difference between the imagined, possible the reality of the probable is marginal, isolated, miniscule and therefore contained.\nThe challenge to the AI community is to contain  runaway metaphorical thinking, where the  public looks to close down human capacity for social innovation and sustainability.[5]  Military, design, engineering, accounting, medical, scientific, manufacturing and education are just some of the fields already augmenting artificial intelligence with human management.\nAs AI, Metaphor is one of the tools of a [1] ''knowledge society'' and to ''human-centered'' technologies and systems. One the attributes of anything artificial is that it is stagnant, engrafted and reflective of its creator, it does not have its own free will at least not that beyond what has been given by its designers.  While humans change and adopt the artificial remains as it was unless it also has the ability to rebuild, adopt and change. This scope, range and amplitude of this capacity are likewise conditioned by its creator. Like a work of architecture, machine, weapons and medical equipment,  self analysis, reprogramming and change are built-in. Dividing the discipline''s metaphors between technical [hh]  and conceptual can improve AI’s and architecture’s mutual interactions.\nThe brain can be simulated. Hans Moravec, Ray Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.  [K] "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the "mind" might be.  The resolution to my claims is that AI’s and architecture’s mutual interactions will be improved by metaphoric axioms is supported by claims, inferences and warrants as AI’s and architecture’s mutual interactions will not only manage marginal risks but be improved by metaphoric axioms which will have an impact on the future of architecture and AI field.\nPhilosophers and scientists concerned with ethics, morals and sociopolitical agreements critically challenge [J] the limits of intelligent machines while proponents of architectural metaphoric axioms recreate the capabilities of the human mind.  These philosophers and scientists question if there is an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence. They wonder can a machine have a mind and consciousness. There is already a difference in perception between scholars and practitioners. Since both humans and machines perceive their environment and take actions they maximize their chances of success and manage risks while  they likewise wonder if machines have a similar human capacity and capability to discern metaphors.\n“The field  (artificial  intelligence) was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligence—the sapience of Homo sapiens—can be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine.[2]  Can the artificial find the range of unpredictable, whimsical, and historical stored in the human be replicated. While for one it may be replicated but what about the trillions of other possibilities and potentials in humans not inherent in the artificial, as man, so does AI manage risks.  [3] “Roughly speaking, AI is the attempt by computer scientists to model or simulate intelligent behavior on computers” This in and of itself is metaphoric, where one thing is stated in terms of the other. The intelligent behavior is the commonplace/commonality to both the human and the machine.\nWe seem to want to make machines like us because we are the commonality. If we cannot clone mankind we can clone our body similar to the ancients who strove to be immortalized and as man so does AI manage risks.\n\n\n\nThe mind-machine metaphor, central to AI, appears in jurisprudence as well. Sometimes it is explicit, as in Jerome Frank''s image of the judicial slot machine: Judging is seen as a process wherein cases are fed into the hopper of the machine, a crank is turned, and justice is dispensed at the output. [3] The field of artificial intelligence is interesting to a student of metaphor, because it was explicitly founded upon a metaphor - several of them, in fact.\nIn the 1950s, a group of scientists decided to try to provide the computer with intelligence. Their goal seemed attainable due to a common metaphorical identification of the computer with a brain. [4] From their efforts emerged the field of artificial intelligence, or AI. As I thought about the basic, or root metaphors of AI, I realized that they took a form resembling a classical syllogism, a mode of argument that forms the core of the body of Western logical thought. Aristotle defined syllogistic logic, and his formulations were thought to be the final word in logic; they underwent only minor revisions in the subsequent 2,200 years: one of the axioms driving the relationship is that the computer is a brain, the premise in a syllogism containing the minor term, which will form the subject of the conclusion.\n“Thinking is computing, [Y] concluding that if we provide the computer with sophisticated programs, it will develop a mind similar to human minds. [4], in risk free circumstances. Artificial systems and the biological ones are similar for their dynamicity, because they cope with the new situations in a way that is controlled and creative at the same time. [H]. In the case of architectural design this can only leads to safer, healthier and “greener’ buildings.  [5] There is a body of study comparing AI to metaphors as I did in 1967 comparing architecture to metaphors. [C]. There is ample discussions on the analogies, symbolisms and metaphors linking machines and minds, computers and humans , and artificial intelligence with natural intelligence it is therefore beneficial to apply the science, claims and axioms about metaphors. [D]. But what about axioms derived by social, psychological, philosophical, cognitive scientist?  In other works [T] I have derived 83 axioms which I could apply both here have only discussed the ones with major comparative value. As they did with AI we did with architecture and are using these axioms and findings to compare human and machines. For example [7] humans are able to generate metaphors by describing an operation in an unfamiliar way and thus able to make what was already somewhat known dominant.\nThe generative metaphor is the name for a process of symptoms of a particular kind of seeing-as, the “meta-pherein” or “carrying –over” of frames or perspectives from one domain of experience to another. This process he calls generative which many years earlier WJ Gordon called the Metaphoric Way of Knowing [E] and 2.1 Paul Weiss called “associations” [F]. Both humans and computers can generate dead metaphors where one  really does not contain any fresh metaphor insofar as it does not really “get thoughts across”; [8] “language seems rather to help one person to construct out of his own stock of mental stuff something like a replica, or copy,  of someone’s else’s thoughts”.\nMan’s natural culture is a product of man-made, unnatural things, that instead of culture shaping the computer it is the computer (artificial intelligence) that shapes the culture.  At first, culture creates the machines then the artificial intelligence modifies the culture. Then new modified culture creates new machines, etc.   [9] The affect of the metaphor on other metaphors with all its links and consequences is manifest in the conduit [8] which leads to one after the other and a continuation of the first.\nOn the one hand AI can result in prescriptive design vs. abnormal, different, irregular, occasional, rare, sometime, and unusual design solutions with such projects as CFS truss system[cc], Arup/cultural society[ee]  and emergence [ee].\nEmergence [ee] is an important new concept in artificial intelligence, information theory, digital technology, economics, climate studies, material science and biometric engineering.  It is a development which is set to inform not only the construction of buildings, but also the composition of new materials. As a new science, coupled with material and technological innovations, it is set to enter architecture into a new phase of transition including new material processes and technologies that enable the production of complex architectural forms and effects. Mathematics of emergence underlies advanced manufacturing processes, how it is incorporated in the design process by scientists developing new materials, by mass market and niche product manufacturers, by engineers and by architects.\nThe new science demands new strategies for design, strategies that have a remarkable similarity to the evolutionary design development and optimization processes of nature. It involves the intersection of a broad scope of disciplines including advanced structural and biomimetic engineering, the mathematics of morphogenesis and computer science with particular respect to artificial life and evolutionary computation, in order to set forth an operative notion of emergence for architectural design [aa] .\nAxiom Digest\nWithin the parameters of risk management [ff] these axioms are self-evident principles that can be accepted on face-value as a true basis for argument since they have already been proven and described by the noted referent for each. Here they are postulates (or inferences) without their warrants. As such each is noted as to source and location for reference gleaned from “Metaphor and Thought” [6] (footnoted as 1._._ throughout).There are additional references noted below. The footnotes are sub-axioms meant to both support the axiom while also being useful as an independent principle. The below axioms are predominantly derived from “Metaphors and Thought” [6]  by Andrew Ortony, earlier mentoring by Dr. Paul Weiss and are in addition to over forty years of work about my stasis to architecture as art being that “architecture as the making of metaphors” (please see background [C] below after the monograph for your information).\nAxioms are self-evident principles that I have deduced out of Ortony’s Metaphor and Thought [6] and accept as true without proof as the basis for future arguments; a postulates or inferences including their  warrants (which I have footnoted as 1._._ throughout). These axioms are in themselves clarification, enlightenment, and illumination removing ambiguity where the derivative reference (Ortony) has many applications. Hopefully, these can be starting points from which other statements can be logically derived. Unlike theorems, axioms cannot be derived by principles of deduction as I wrote: "The metametaphor theorem" published by Architectural Scientific Journal, Vol. No. 8; 1994 Beirut Arab University. [gg]   The below axioms  define  properties for the domain of a specific theory which eve loved out of the stasis defending architecture as an art and in that  sense, a "postulate” and "assumption" . Thusly, I presume to axiomatize a system of knowledge to show that these claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms).\n“Universality, Global uniqueness, Sameness, Identity, and Identity abuse” are just some of the axioms of web architecture.  Francis Hsu of Rutgers writes that “Software Architecture Axioms is a worthy goal. First, let''s be clear that software axioms are not necessarily mathematical in nature”.\nFurthermore, in his book titled The Book of Architecture Axioms  Gavin Terrill wrote: “Simplify essential complexity; diminish accidental complexity; You''re negotiating more often than you think ;It''s never too early to think about performance and resiliency testing;  Fight repetition; Don''t Control, but Observe and Architect as Janitor”.  In “Axiomatic design in the customizing home building industry published by  Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management; 2002;vol 9; issue 4;page 318-324  Kurt  Psilander wrote that “the developer would find a tool very useful that systematically and reliably analyses customer taste in terms of functional requirements (FRs). Such a tool increases the reliability of the procedure the entrepreneur applies to chisel out a concrete project description based on a vision of the tastes of a specific group of customers. It also ensures that future agents do not distort the developer''s specified FRs when design parameters are selected for the realization of the project. Axiomatic design is one method to support such a procedure. This tool was developed for the manufacturing industry but is applied here in the housing sector. Some hypothetical examples are presented”. Aside from building-architect’s axioms claiming that “form follows function”; “follow manufacturer’s requirements and local codes and ordinances”, “AIA standards for professional practice” architectural axioms are few and far between. Each has been summarized, paraphrased and translated into architectural terms. Because of the speed and memory capacity it is not far fetched that an AI architectural system could receive, analyze and match requirements with codes, ordinances and industry standards which will impact the future of both building and AI architecture.\nCompendium of Axioms\nThe first axiom permits all the others in that it claims that ideas and concepts are the reality of what we create. These images are also the commonality linking our impression with facts on the ground. [10] Novel images and image metaphors are conceptual and not the works themselves, but their mental images. “All metaphors are invariant with respect to their cognitive topology, that is, each metaphorical mapping preserves image-schema structure:” Likewise when we look at the geometrical formal parts of an AI architectural metaphor we note those common elements where fit, coupling and joints occur.\nWe remember that which exemplified the analogous match.  This observation of the metaphor finds that the commonality, commonplace and similarity are the chief focus of the metaphor. Humans and mechanized readers both may note either the obscure or subtle as the way two horizontal axes of the land and then a building are wed by their commonality of horizontality affecting the future of both architectures.\nNatural Intelligence (NI) and AI note the 90 degree angles and shape that slide into one another. AI and NI and note the way like metals, clips and angles fit; the way ceiling ducts are made to fit between structures and hung ceiling, etc.\nWhile it is less possible for AI to spontaneously imagine the way AI could relate the human form to a building when humans circulate through its halls, rooms and closets its accommodation to our needs and necessities; to our self preservation and the maintenance of the building become apparent.\nBoth can map the building structure to humans by finding the one commonality amongst all the others. Very often we will hear someone (user) say this place is” me”. The common image has been located and the fit made.   The way to arrive at generic-level schemes for some knowledge structure is to extract its image; its image-schematic structure is the Invariance Principle. Obviously this is best done by architecture’s human inhabitant; this is called the Generic’s Specific Structure. It is an extremely common mechanism for comprehending the general from the specific. So what you can deduce for part you can assume is true of the whole. The human architect controls the mechanical and artificial; however, they both must share their intelligence where the artificial analyses and presents it findings to man for further action. Whether a human can preprogram an AI devise to perceive the infinite number of human “fit” characteristics seems formidable. As today, much depends on the return on investment and the capacity of creators to program the device, the programmer, scientist and operator will only do what is efficient and necessary. You may call it the biggest bang for the buck axiom, where humans may falter and awake to a new paradigm where AI devices are designed to always succeed.  It is any of the three levels of [aa] Axioms contextual forms.\nPlausible accounts [10] rather than scientific results are why we have conventional metaphors and why conceptual systems contain a preference for one set of metaphorical mappings over another. An artificial intelligence establishes its own vocabulary which once comprehended become the way in which we experience its’ product’s finding. Its discrepancies and fits seek the first and all the other similar elements while humans judge consistency, integrity and aesthetics of AI.  The two have their respective roles. The human monitors, manages and controls wile the AI system performs anticipated intelligent operations leaving the human to find variances and reprogram. In this way AI in general and the application in particular evolves and impacts both architectures\nMetaphor is the main mechanism through which humans comprehend abstract concepts and perform abstract reasoning.  Whether it is one or thousands public cultures is influenced, bound and authenticated by its’ metaphors. Not withstanding “idolatry” the metaphors are the contexts of life’s dramas and as our physical bodies are read by our neighbors finding evidence for inferences about social, political and philosophical claims about our culture and its place in the universe.\nFor humans much subject matter, from the most mundane to the most abstruse scientific theories, can only be comprehended via metaphor However, AI capacity is limited only by its microprocessor chips and RAM.  Metaphor is fundamentally conceptual, not linguistic, in nature.\nHuman’s free will, whim, natural functions and being the original indigenous native inhabitants characterize man over his artificial creations. Left to its own AI would create a world of possible machine parts, systems and structures well suited for artificial intelligent life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaphorical language is a surface manifestation of conceptual metaphor.\nAs language is to speech so is output to AI where each has a content and inner meaning of the whole as well as each of its parts. As each word, each attachment, plain, material, structure had first been conceived to achieve some purpose and fill some need. Hidden from the reader is the inner psychology, social background, etc of the man when speaking and the programming deign and contacting process from the reader of a building metaphor. As in completing an argument the reader perceives the inferences with its warrants and connects the evidence of the seen to the claims to make the resolution of the whole, all of which are surmised from the surface.\nThough much of our conceptual system is metaphorical a significant part of it is non-metaphorical. Metaphorical understanding is grounded in non-metaphorical understanding.  AI is well suited to the architectural science of the strength of materials, mathematics, structures, indeterminate beams, truss design, mechanical systems, plumbing systems, electricity, cladding, finishes, lighting, etc. as are each understood metaphorically and their precepts applied metaphorically. But often random selections, trials and feasibility are random and rather in search of the metaphor without knowing whether it is or is not a metaphor and fit to be part of the metaphor at hand. AI will not know the relevant commonality. It may select some commonality but chances are it will be irrelevant and as incongruous as often are language translations selecting incongruous phrases and usages. It is for such a risk that human management and monitoring may be required.\nOn the other hand we may select one or another based on non-metaphorical, empirical test and descriptions of properties. We then try to understand the metaphor in the selection, its commonality, how it contributes to the new application, how it has properties within itself which are alone strange and unrelated yet when coupled with the whole or part of the created metaphor contributes to metaphor.  Metaphor allows humans to understand a relatively abstract or inherently unstructured subject matter in terms of a more concrete or at least more highly structured subject matter. Like the onomatopeics metaphors mappings of conceptions override the overt spoken and descriptive, and rely much more on mnemonics (something intended to assist the memory, as a verse or formula). Peculiar to the human, assistance comes from something much more primordial (constituting a beginning; giving origin to something derived or developed; original; elementary: primordial forms of life) to the person’s or societies experiences. Again, it is for such a risk that human management and monitoring may be required, an architectural design may warrant human invasiveness into the process.\nHowever, once completed these become the matrix (encyclopedic) of schemas (in argument; the warrants {where a warrant is a license to make an inference and as such must have reader''s agreement} supporting the inferences (mappings) where in the metaphor becomes real).\nIn this way the reader maps, learns and personalizes the strange into the realm of the familiar. The reader does so by the myriad of synaptic connections he is able to apply to that source.\nHence humans translate their conceptions from philosophy, psychology, sociology, etc into two dimensional scaled drawings and then to real life full scale multi dimensions convention consisting of conventional materials, building elements the task of upload axioms to AI would take a lifetime of dedicated specialist [aa].\nWell suited to AI as maps are the result of cartographers rendering existing into a graphics for reading so is mapping to the reading of metaphors where the reader renders understanding from one source to another. Doing so mentally and producing a rendition of understanding (as a pen and ink of a figure) not as a graphic but a conceptual understanding.  The best risk management  is when reader sees in a critical way the existing culling through and encyclopedia of referents to make the true relationship; the mapping which best renders the reality; the relationship which informs and clarifies as the map the location, configuration and characteristic of the reality. As the cartographer seeks lines, symbols and shadings to articulate the reality so the reader choices of heretofore unrelated and seemingly unrelated  are found to have and essence common to both the reality and the rendition so that the metaphor can be repeated becoming the readers new vocabulary .  In fact architects do the opposite as graphic renditions are made of synapses between amorphic and seemingly desperate information. This relationship between axiom and performance assure for program conformity and reliability.\nYet the process of mapping is no less intense as architect review the matrix of conditions, operation , ideal and goals of the thesis to find similarities and differences , commonalities, and potential for one to resonate with another to make a “resolution” on the experience of a cognitive mapping which becomes the metaphor, parte and overwhelming new reality. The new reality is the target of the source and finally can be read.  In the case of the birth of an infant metaphor readers may find a wide variety of source information which is germane to their own experience.\nBefore the public ever sees the constructed metaphor Building Officials, manufactures, city planners, owners, estimators, general contactors, specialty contractors, environmentalist, neighbors and community organization first read the drawings and map their observations to their issues to form a slanted version of the reality. Human manager can easily monitor this variance and modify the performance.  Their mappings are based on the warrants which are their licensed to perform. Each warrant will support a different mapping (inference) and result in its own metaphor. In effect each will see a kind of reality of the proposed in the perspective of their peculiar warrant, where license is permission from authority to do something. It is assumed if one gets permission it has met the conditions, operations, ideal and goals of the proposed metaphor. As risk is managed by other professions, operations and systems mapping is critical at this read to assure that the architect’s rendering of the program is faithful to the cognitive, lawful, physical and legal realities.\nIt s like a map which gets tested by scientist, navigators , pilots and engineers before they build a craft to use the map, or set out on a journey using the map. Before the contracts start committing men and material the metaphor must map and be the metaphor meeting all expectations.\nAs there is metaphor between natural (NI) and artificial intelligence (AI) in cognitive linguistics, conceptual metaphor, or cognitive metaphor, refers to the understanding of one idea, or conceptual domain, in terms of another, for example, understanding quantity in terms of directionality (e.g. "prices are rising"). A conceptual domain can be any coherent organization of human experience.\nThe regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, which often appear to be perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain.\nEach mapping (where mapping is the systematic set of correspondences) that exist is between constituent elements of the source and the target domain. [I] Many elements of target concepts come from source domains and are not preexisting. To know a conceptual metaphor is to know the set of mappings that applies to a given source-target pairing. The same idea of mapping between source and target is used to describe analogical reasoning and inferences) is a fixed set of ontological (relating to essence or the nature of being) correspondences between entities in source domain and entities in target domain.\nThere is a list of over 100 schemas in many categories about basic human behavior, reactions and actions. These schemas are the realms in which the mappings takes place much the same as the inferences in arguments have warrants and link evidence to claims so do these schemas, architects carry-over their experiences with materials, physics, art, culture, building codes, structures, plasticity, etc. to form metaphor. Identifying conditions, operations, ideals and goals are combined to form plans, sections and elevations which are then translated in to contract documents. Later the contractors map this metaphor based on their schemes of cost, schedule and quality control into schedules and control documents.\nHumans interact with their environments based on their physical dimensions, capabilities and limits. [F] The field of anthropometrics (human measurement) has unanswered questions, but it''s still true that human physical characteristics are fairly predictable and objectively measurable. Buildings scaled to human physical capabilities have steps, doorways, railings, work surfaces, seating, shelves, fixtures, walking distances, and other features that fit well to the average person.  [F] Humans also interact with their environments based on their sensory capabilities. The fields of human perception systems, like perceptual psychology and cognitive psychology, are not exact sciences, because human information processing is not a purely physical act, and because perception is affected by cultural factors, personal preferences, experiences, and expectations, so human scale in architecture can also describe buildings with sightlines, acoustic properties, task lighting, ambient lighting, and spatial grammar that fit well with human senses. However, one important caveat is that human perceptions are always going to be less predictable and less measurable than physical dimensions.\nFor humans mappings are not arbitrary, but grounded in the body and in every day experience and knowledge. Mapping and making metaphors are synonymous. The person and not the work make the metaphor. Without the body and the experience of either the author or the reader nothing is being made. The thing does not have but the persons have the experiences. As language, craft, and skills are learned by exercise, repetition and every day application so are mappings.\nMappings are not subject to individual judgment or preference: but as a result of making seeking and finding the commonality by practice.  Humans learn to associate, create and produce by years of education and practice while users have a longer history approaching and mapping for use and recognition. Yet new metaphors are difficult to assimilate without daily use and familiarity. AI overcomes this and stores limited memory in RAM. A conceptual system contains thousands of conventional metaphorical mappings which form a highly structured subsystem of the conceptual system.\n\nOver the year’s society, cultures, families and individuals experience and store a plethora of mapping routines which are part of our mapping vocabulary.  There are two types of mappings: conceptual mappings and image mappings; both obey the Invariance Principle.  “A. Image metaphors are not exact “look-alikes” ;many sensory mechanisms are at work, which can be characterized by Langacker’s focal adjustment (selection, perspective, and abstraction); B. images and Image-schemas are continuous; an image can be abstracted/schematized to various degrees; and C. image metaphors and conceptual metaphors are continuous; conceptual metaphorical mapping preserves image-schematic structure (Lakoff 1990) and image metaphors often involve conceptual aspects of the source image. (“All metaphors are invariant with respect to their cognitive topology, that is, each metaphorical mapping preserves image-schema structure:”\nLikewise when we look at the geometrical formal parts of an architectural metaphor we note those common elements where fitting, coupling and joints occur), again this simultaneity of ideas and image operating in tandem where we see and know an idea simultaneously; where the convention of the architectural space and the metaphor of the conception converge. Such an axiom is the commonality between man and machine, AI and human architecture and AI mechanism and its manager.\nFor both AI and humans the invariance principle offers the hypothesis that metaphor only maps components of meaning from the source language that remain coherent in the target context. The components of meaning that remain coherent in the target context retain their "basic structure" in some sense, so this is a form of invariance.\nFor humans there will be all sorts of incongruities, similarities and differences.  Both humans and AI can experience onomatopeics  metaphors that are  onomatopoeic (grouping of words that imitates the sound it is describing, suggesting its source object, such as "click", "bunk", "clang", "buzz", "bang", or animal noises such as "oink", "moo", or "meow") ? In this case an assemblage instead of a sound.  As a non-linguistic it has impact beyond words and is still a metaphor. Then a metaphor is much more than the sum of its parts and is beyond any of its constituent constructions, parts and systems, its very existence a metaphor. The cost to convey inconsistencies, variables and nuances of human life can be formidable.\nElegant architectural metaphors are those in which the big idea and the smallest of details echo and reinforce one another manifest in paraphrasing where “people ascertain the deep metaphor that underlies one or more surface metaphors by filling in terms of an implicitly analogy”. [11] It is the “filling in” wherein the [L] synapse (a region where nerve impulses are transmitted and received, encompassing the axon terminal of a neuron that releases neurotransmitters in response to an impulse) takes place.\nThe difference between the indirect uses of metaphor verses the direct use of language to explain the world. . In some circles this is referred to tangential thinking, that approaching a subject from its edges without getting to the point.\n[12] Users can accept works which are vague, inane, and non-descript, evasive, and disorienting as between micro and macro metaphors and the way they can inform one another as the form of design may refer to its program, or a connector may reflect the concept of articulation as a design concept. Both machines and people have this capability, however the unpredictable human range is far more diverse and original.  The macro metaphor drives the micro while they both inform one another.\n\nMetaphors work by “reference to analogies that are known to relate to the two domains”. In other words there is apriori knowledge of these before they are spoken and when heard they are immediately found. [13] Metaphors are formed in the human discovery of the obvious where one analogy begets another which may or may not be relevant but be interesting enough to explore and find a new referent. AI may receive, store and associate these to its existing but has only its artificial collective repertoire. Hover, as Microsoft spell-check it can learn, assimilate and recreate.\nA” problem of the metaphor concerns the relations between the word and sentence meaning, on the one hand, and speaker’s meaning or utterance meaning, on the other” [14] “Whenever we talk about the metaphorical meaning of a word, expression, or sentence, we are talking about what a speaker might utter it to mean, in a way it that departs from what the word, expression or sentence actually means”.   Without apparent rhyme of reason metaphors of all arts have a way of recalling other metaphors of other times and places.\n ‘Human cognition is fundamentally shaped by various processes of figuration”. “The ease with which many figurative utterances are comprehended are has often  been attributed to the constraining influence of the context” ………..Including [15] “the common ground of knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes recognized as being shared by speakers and listeners (architects and users(clients, public) As speakers architects, designers and makers “can’t help but employ tropes in every day conversation (design) because they conceptualize (design) much of their experience through the figurative schemes of metaphor (design).   A metaphor involves a nonliteral use of language”. [16] A non-literal use of language means that what is said is for affect and not for specificity.\nMinimizing risk, metaphor is an abbreviated simile and to appreciate similarities and analogies which is called “appreciation”. [17] In psychology “appreciation” (Herbert (1898) was a general term for those mental process whereby an attached experience is brought into relation with an already acquired and familiar conceptual system (Encoding, mapping, categorizing, inference, assimilation and accommodation, attribution, etc).\nMetaphors build an image in the (AI system) mind, that is to say we (AI) “appreciate” what we already know. I have always contended that we do not learn anything we already do not know. We learn in terms of already established knowledge and concepts. We converse reiterating what we presume the other knows, otherwise the other party would not understand. The other party understands only because he already knows. In this way humans and machines are alike. Early stages of AI architectural application with architectural metaphoric axioms is best executed on commercial, industrial projects with little interior detail and which can be closely monitored. The risk of failure or mis-design my be simply mitigated after the completion but before submittal to building officials for code reviewed.\nThe risks are fairly minimal since there are already phases in the design process which firewall the errors being transferred from one stage of development to the other. This in and of itself minimizes risk; Along with AI/BIM checking risk will be controlled.\nThe architect who assembles thousands of  bits of information , resifts  and converts form words to graphics and specification documents communicates the new proposed (the strange new thing) in terms of the known and familiar.\nThe first recipients are the owner, building officials; contractors must read seeking confirmations of known and confirm its adherence to expectations. After its construction the users read familiar signs, apparatus, spaces, volumes, shapes and forms. The bridge carries over from one to another what is already known .Even the strange that becomes familiar are both known but not in the current relationship. For example when we apply a technology used on ships to a building or a room which is commonly associated with tombs as a bank, etc. Both are generally known but not in that specific context. We could not appreciate it if it were not known .It is what Weiss calls commonalties and is the selection between commonalties and differences that makes a metaphor. About understanding and discerning between what is” true in fact” and “true in the model”. Since the gathering, assimilation and observation of human contributions is often exx43nstiol this is best done by humans to humans in teams known by some architects as “squatting”. [bb]\nPrototype theory is a mode of graded categorization in cognitive science, where some members of a category are more central than others. For example, when asked to give an example of the concept furniture, chair is more frequently cited than, say, stool.” [18]   “Metaphors are generally used to describe something new by references to something familiar not just in conversation, but in such diverse areas as science and psychotherapy. For both men and machines metaphors are not just nice, they are necessary.  They are necessary for casting abstract concepts in terms of the apprehendable, as we do, for example, when we metaphorically extend spatial concepts and spatial terms to the realms of temporal concepts and temporal terms.\nMetaphor is reasoning using abstract characters whereas reason by analogy is a straight forward extension of its use in commonplace reasoning. [19] All this to say and as if there was a choice that architects have a choice where to make a new building by analogy or by metaphor. Analogies may be the ticky-tacks, office building, church, school building, fire station analogies to a first model verses an abstraction of a program into a new prototype. Is the analogy any less a work of architecture?\nOr do we only mean that works of architecture are works of art when they make abstractions?  Humans are able to design by metaphor whereas an artificial intelligence designs by analogy. [M] “In processing analogy, people implicitly focus on certain kinds of commonalities and ignore others”.  Noting these things an industry was created called the “housing industry’ churning out analogies rather than individual metaphors, leaving the metaphor to the context or theme of the development. It is famous architects who are mostly famous because they made metaphors and from them analogies were drawn. The analogous phenomenon has resulted in the nineteenth century Sears offering pre-designed and package barns ready to ship form Wisconsin to any where by mail order. Pre-engineered metal being and manufactured homes are all part of the analogous scheme of reasoning the built environment. Users have access to either and are able to shift perceptions. In commonplace users wanting to be fed by metaphorical architecture go to Disney, European, or urban entertainment and recreation centers.\nLas Vegas thrives on what I call "metaphoric analogies” abstractions of analogous building types. It is that synapse which attracts and beguiles the visitor hungry for authenticity and reality. Living in analogous urban replicas city dweller migrated to the suburbs in search of the metaphor of “a man’s home is his castle”.\nToday this metaphor has become an analogy as the metaphor proliferates and analogies are transferred from one to another state and country.  We may be told a “cell is like a factory” which gives us a framework for analogy and similarity.   [19] An analogy is a kind of highly selective similarity where we focus on certain commonalities and ignore others. The commonality is no that they are both built out of bricks but that they both take in resources to operate and to generate their products. On the creative and architect’s side: “the central idea is that an analogy is a mapping of knowledge from one domain (the base) into another (the target) such that a system of relations that holds among the base objects also holds among the target objects”. On the user’s side in interpreting an analogy, people seek to put objects of the base in one-to-one correspondence with the objects of the targets as to obtain the maximum structural match”. Confronting a Bedouin village of tents a westerner faced with apparent differences looks for similarities.   “The corresponding objects in the base and target need not resemble each other; rather object correspondences are determined by the like roles in the matching relational structures.” Cushions for seats, carpets for flooring, stretched fabric for walls, roof, and cable for beams and columns, etc.   “Thus, an analogy is a way of aligning and focusing on rational commonalities independently of the objects in which those relationships are embedded.” 	However, there may be metaphors at work as well as the user reads the tent’s tension cable structure, banners and the entire assemblage in a “romantic” eclectic image of Arabness, metaphors beyond the imperial but of the realm of the abstract and inaccurate. Managing the process by quality checking the information from the fist domain minimizes risk assuring that analogy will be correct.\n“Central to the mapping process is the principle of “systematicity: people prefer to map systems of predicates favored by higher-order relations with inferential import (the Arab tent), rather that to map isolated predicates. The systematicity principle reflects a tacit preference for coherence and inferential power in interpreting analogy”. Metaphors work by applying to the principle (literal) subject of the metaphor a system of “associated implications” [20] characteristic of the metaphorical secondary subject. These implications are typically provided by the received “commonplaces” (ordinary; undistinguished or uninteresting; without individuality: a commonplace person.)  About the secondary subject ‘The success of the metaphor rests on its success in conveying to the listener (Reader) some quieter defines respects of similarity or analogy between the principle and secondary subject, “human and AI design by translating concepts into two dimensional graphics that which ultimately imply a multidimensional future reality.\n “Dubbing” (invest with any name, character, dignity, or title; style; name; call)   and “epistemic access” (relating to, or involving knowledge; cognitive.), “when dubbing is abandoned the link between language and the world disappears”. [21]\nArchitectural metaphors are all about names, titles, and the access to that the work provides for the reader to learn and develop. At its best the vocabulary of the parts and whole of the work is an encyclopedia and cultural building block.\nThe work incorporates the current state of man’s culture and society which is an open book for the reader.  The freedom of both the creator and reader to dub and show is all part of the learning experience of the metaphor.  As a good writer “shows” and not “tells” so a good designer manifests configurations without words.\n\nHowever objective, thorough and scientific; the designer, the design tools and the work gets dubbed with ideas (not techne) we may call style, personality, and identity above and beyond the program and its basic design (techne). It is additional controls, characterizations and guidelines engrafted into the form not necessarily overtly and expressly required.  Dubbing may occur in the making of metaphors as a way in which the design itself is conceived and brought together. Dubbing may in fact be the process which created the work as an intuitive act.\n[22] Consider new concepts as being characterized in terms of old ones (plus logical conjunctives)” [E]  As William J. Gordon points out we make the strange familiar by talking about one thing in terms of another.\n[22] “Knowledge” would not itself be conceptual or be expressed in the medium of thought, and therefore it would not be cognitively structured, integrated with other knowledge, or even comprehended. Hence, it would be intellectually inaccessible”. In other words we would not know that we know. Where knowing is the Greek for suffer, or experience. This was the Greek ideal proved in Oedipus; “through suffering man learns”; we know that we know. Therefore, when we observe that architecture makes metaphors we mean that we know that we know that works exists and we can read authors messages. We learn the work and improve the more artificial intelligence impacts the future of architecture. While architectural metaphoric axioms are proactive the context is benign and does not pose the catastrophic calamity doomsday- sayers prophesied. Still, it is good to know that Axioms provide the checks and balances to a successful and safe AI performance.\nPostscript: Aesthetics, human to machine admixture and AI as complex design tool\nToday it is possible for AI to design complex structures making possible the use of materials and structures heretofore uneconomical, too costly and time consuming to ever be considered, for example the steel light weight truss system  [cc] of a conventional roof .\nNot withstanding the work of Afrred I Tauber’s Elusive Synthesis: Aesthetics and Science and considering the five senses of human experience defining aesthetics at best warrants a negotiated and interdependency between man and his AI system. What can be systemically or specifically  programmed will never reconstruct the human that directly senses and then with a sixth sense makes some  illogical but yet pleasing redirection to himself feel, experience and enjoy the environment. Aesthetics is a guiding principle in matters of artistic beauty and taste, metaphor is the warrant to taste and is used to form works of art and architecture. Aesthetics is also reasoning matters having to do with understanding perceptions. While AI tools may be designed to replicate man’s abilities to navigate, perceive, and judge the environment, AI cannot enjoy the experience as one man (or the collective of all men).Then the AI device still refers back to its creator to make sense of the events. It is to this extent that AI thinking can intelligently, without the normative sense feedback, be involved in aesthetic experience, judgment and consciousness. It is its limitation of total sovereignty, autonomy and independence of AI.\n\n\n\n\nIt is likewise questionable, as a design device, to replace human designers as the affects the quality of the aesthetics of the design outcomes.  But there is  no doubt that the AI designer can change the paradigms of design outcomes where time, space and cost would otherwise be prohibited and therefore could potentially expand the, scope , breadth and depth of programs to fully design green buildings, solve  environmental issues, optimize, use of space, materials and use materials in new ways.\nMulti-disciplinary access from arts, sciences, philosophies are economical and feasible with enough capacity and devises so that buildings and their systems can include the sculptors aesthetics for shapes and forms, the musicians ear for lyrical, harmony and the poets sense of rhyme, sense and inference, Not to mention behavior psychologist parameters of sequences and impacts of color, spaces, and distances, etc. AI design will also facilitate client, user and occupant participation in the design process. So while AI can perceive and act on signs of the senses the artificial is not natural and has no natural understanding of the senses. Aesthetically, as “beauty is in the eyes of the beholder” the AI does “be” but not “behold”.  In fact, since the world in which man inhabits us actually design more and not les control of our habitations, that is while we wish our habitations to be designed more humanely than machine, meaning that ideally it would be designed by us. “Us” being natural man augmented by a device but not managed by that device. We do not desire the aesthetic of machines.  As example we don’t want to live in a factory, industrial park or warehouse. Even living in a space capsule can only be for limited times as it is devoid of nature. It is nature and free will which artificial lacks. AI is not a sinister possibility but an opportunity to optimize the efficiency of nature in human terms. Human architects both compose the program and manage to reify its contents from words to diagrams and diagrams to two dimensional graphics and three dimensional models to reify and bring- out (educate) the user’s mind and fulfillment of unspoken and hidden needs. Needs which may or may not have been programmed and intended; the metaphor is the final resolution until it is built and used.\nThen it is subject to further tests of time, audience, trends, social politics, demographic shifts, economics, and cultural changes. The aesthetics of the process and the product are indigenous to natural man metaphor and a can be metaphorically assimilated by artificial intelligence architects.\nConclusion:\nThe risks which AI architectural axioms mitigate are benign, local and parochial to the profession and pose little danger to the general public. However, as a model and safe to develop it may be the proving ground and fist small step to bolster public confidence to consider applying AI to other applications which pose more of a risk public welfare.', 0, '0', '', '', 0, 0);

Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href="http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212; go mathletes! </em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/07/event-organizers-unite/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:45:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 3.4.1 Maintenance and Security Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:57:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2383";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:379:"WordPress 3.4.1 is now available for download.

For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, and of course custom image headers. We have more planned for the customizer down the road.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the admin you&#8217;ll notice tweaks to make your everyday life easier. For example, if you have lots of themes we&#8217;ve made it quicker to browse them all at once without paging. We&#8217;ve made it possible to use images from your media library to populate custom headers, and for you to choose the height and width of your header images.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded our embed support to include tweets: just put a Twitter permalink on its own line in the post editor and we&#8217;ll turn it into a beautiful embedded Tweet. And finally, image captions have been improved to allow HTML, like links, in them.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of under-the-hood improvements in this release, notably in the XML-RPC, themes, and custom header APIs, and significant performance improvements in WP_Query and the translation system. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4">dive into Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/">put together a busy developer&#8217;s field guide to the new APIs in 3.4</a>.</p>\n<h3>It takes a village</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the fine folks who were involved in bringing 3.4 to the world:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/082net">082net</a>, <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

There are over <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">19,000 plugins listed</a> and they&#8217;re really the heart and soul of WordPress for many people, so they deserve a little tender loving care. Here&#8217;s a quick before and after snapshot you can zoom in on to see a visual overview of some of the changes:</p>\n<p><a href="http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png"><img src="http://s2.wp.com/imgpress?resize=690,350&amp;url=http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png&amp;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3" alt="" /></a></p>\n<p>Our first focus was around improving the discussion and support around plugins.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now notice that threads about a plugin are pulled directly into a &#8220;support&#8221; tab on the plugin page &#8212; each plugin has its own forum. We&#8217;ve made authors much more prominent and with bigger Gravatars and better placement, so you can get a sense of who made the plugin you&#8217;re using. And finally to show how active and well-supported a plugin is, you can see  &#8221;16 of 75 support threads in the last two weeks have been resolved.&#8221; Finally, if you&#8217;re logged in you get access to the new &#8220;favorites&#8221; feature that lets you mark the plugins you use the most so you can share them on your profile page and find them quickly later. We soft-launched favorites a few days ago and there have already been 2,000 saved!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin author, we&#8217;ve started with a short threshold (2 weeks) for the resolved stats so it&#8217;s easy to catch up and stay on top of it. (It&#8217;ll eventually go to two months.) You also now have the ability to set stickies on your plugin forum to put FAQs or important information at the top, and of course any person you put as a committer on the plugin will have moderation access. People on the forum tag will see your custom header and links to the other resources attached to your plugin.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tightened up the styling a bit on the forums and plugin pages, though still some cleanups to do there. Some older improvements you might have missed, but are still useful for users and developers alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Plugin headers&#8221; or those cool graphics you see at the top of plugin pages have really taken off, there are over 1,600 active now.</li>\n<li>You can now subscribe to get an email whenever a commit is made to a plugin repository even if it isn&#8217;t yours. There is no better way to follow the development of your favorite plugins. There&#8217;s nothing like the smell of fresh changesets in the morning.</li>\n<li>Behind the scenes, we&#8217;ve dramatically ramped up proactive scanning of the entire repository to help authors fix security and other problems they might not even know about yet. The quality level of the repo has gone way, way up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this will continue to evolve as we get feedback and see usage, but we&#8217;re happy to have been able to make some key improvements in just a few days while hanging out in Memphis. (This is why WordCamps usually have BBQ &#8212; it imparts magical coding powers.)</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/plugins-refreshed/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:45:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"Calling All Contributors: Community Summit 2012";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 May 2012 22:36:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2278";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:334:"Each year, the WordPress core development team meets in person for a week to work together and discuss the vision for WordPress in the coming year.

As annual events go, it&#8217;s easily my favorite. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love attending <a title="WordCamp Central" href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a> and local <a title="WordPress on Meetup.com" href="http://wordpress.meetup.com/">WordPress meetups</a> (which are awesome and you should try to attend if you are able), but at the core team meetup, the focus on working together and getting things done is unique, as is the experience of every person in the room being so highly qualified. This year, instead of just planning a core team meetup, I&#8217;m aiming a little higher and shooting for a full-on contributor/community summit.</p>\n<p>Core code isn&#8217;t the only way to contribute to the WordPress project. We have an active <a title="Theme Review Team blog" href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review team</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forum</a> volunteers, people writing <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">documentation</a>, plugin managers, community event organizers, translators, and more. The teams have been siloed for too long, so we&#8217;ve recently begun the process of bringing them together by having teams elect representatives to facilitate more communication between the contributor groups. These reps will form the nucleus of the contributor summit now being planned for a long weekend at the end of October in Tybee Island, GA. This is completely different from a WordCamp. It will be a combination of co-working, unconference, and discussions among the project leaders, and participation will be by invitation.</p>\n<p>In addition to bringing together the active contributor team reps to work together, I think it&#8217;s important to include community members who don&#8217;t fall into that category (at least not yet!). Successful WordPress-based business, authors of popular plugins and themes, and people using WordPress in unexpected but intriguing ways should have a place at the table, too. That said, part of the magic of the core team meetup is the small size; it allows every voice not only to be heard, but to engage. Since this is my first attempt at bringing together so many groups and points of view, I want to try and keep it small enough to retain that personal atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that the best possible mix of people and businesses in the WordPress ecosystem is represented. This is where you come in!</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from events with limited availability like <a title="AdaCamp" href="http://dc.adacamp.org/">AdaCamp</a> (attendance) and the <a title="jQuery Conference" href="http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/">jQuery conference</a> (speaker roster), I want you to <a title="Nomination survey" href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations">nominate people and/or WordPress-based businesses to participate in the summit</a>. Yes, you can nominate yourself.* You can nominate up to 10 additional people &#8212; be prepared to provide URLs and the reason you think they should participate. You can also nominate up to 10 WordPress-based businesses without naming individual people, so if there&#8217;s a theme or hosting company (for example) that you think should be there, you don&#8217;t need to go looking for employee names. This nomination process will hopefully ensure that we don&#8217;t overlook someone who is making a difference in our community when it comes time to issue invitations.</p>\n<p>Nominations will be open for a week, after which <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations">the survey</a> will be closed and the process of analyzing the results** will begin. The nominations process will lead to invitations in June, confirmations in July, planning in August and September, and the summit itself in October. Hopefully we can stream and/or record some of the activity to share online at <a href="http://wordpress.tv">WordPress.tv</a>. Additional invitations may be extended up until the event if there are people/businesses that become more active in the community. If you&#8217;re thinking to yourself that maybe now&#8217;s the perfect time to start <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress">contributing time to the WordPress project</a>, good thinking! In the meantime, if you want to weigh in, <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations">fill in the community summit nomination form</a>. Thanks, and wish us luck!</p>\n<p><em>* Nominating yourself: Do nominate yourself if you fall into one of the categories described in the post above, or if you believe that you have a unique point of view. Please do not nominate yourself if you just think it would be cool to hang out with this group.

That will tell Akismet not to change its behaviour based on those API calls &#8211; they will have no training effect.  That means your tests will be somewhat repeatable, in the sense that one test won&#8217;t influence subsequent calls.  (Be aware however that Akismet is non-deterministic, so you can expect to see results that change over time.  See below for ways of forcing a specific response when you need a predictable test.)</p>\n<p>There are no separate sandboxes or test servers.  You needn&#8217;t worry about your tests having an effect on anyone else or on Akismet as a whole &#8211; we maintain careful isolation between API keys and users in order to make sure no one can adversely influence Akismet, accidentally or otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Test your API calls</h3>\n<p>Akismet works by examining all the available information combined.  It is not enough to provide just the content of a message; you need to provide as many independent pieces of information as you can in each call.  So before you can test Akismet&#8217;s accuracy, you need to make sure you&#8217;re sending complete and correct information.</p>\n<p>To simulate a positive (spam) result, make a <code><a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#comment-check">comment-check</a></code> API call with the <code>comment_author</code> set to <code>viagra-test-123</code>, and all other required fields populated with typical values.  The Akismet API will always return a <code>true</code> response to a valid request with that value.  If you receive anything else, something is wrong in your client, data, or communications.</p>\n<p>To simulate a negative (not spam) result, make a <code><a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#comment-check">comment-check</a></code> API call with the <code>user_role</code> set to <code>administrator</code>, and all other required fields populated with typical values.  The Akismet API will always return a <code>false</code> response.  Any other response indicates a data or communication problem.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure your client will handle an unexpected response.  Don&#8217;t assume that the <code><a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#comment-check">comment-check</a></code> API will always return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  An invalid request may result in an <code>error</code> response.  Additional information will usually be available in HTTP headers in this case.  And of course a connectivity problem may result in no response at all.  It&#8217;s important not to misinterpret an invalid response as meaning spam or ham.</p>\n<h3>Test your data</h3>\n<p>Akismet is highly dependent on the quality and completeness of the data you provide.  It&#8217;s important to provide <a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/">as many parameters as possible</a>, and to make sure they contain correct values.  If you can&#8217;t populate a particular field because that information is unavailable or irrelevant, use an empty string &#8211; a missing value is better than an incorrect or made up one.</p>\n<p>We recommend capturing a few of your API calls in order to make sure they really do contain the intended values.  It&#8217;s quite common for a bug to cause the user_ip or user_agent value to be incorrect, for example &#8211; make sure they come from the remote browser that posted the comment, and not from your server.</p>\n<p>Also make sure that the values your submit-spam and submit-ham API calls match your comment-check API calls as closely as possible.  In order to learn from its mistakes, Akismet needs to match your missed spam and false positive reports to the original comment-check API call, made when the comment was first posted.  It&#8217;s normal for less information to be available for <code><a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#submit-spam">submit-spam</a>/<a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/#submit-ham">ham</a></code> calls, since most comment systems and forums won&#8217;t store all metadata.  But you should make sure that the values you do send match the originals.  (A common bug is for clients to mistakenly send the moderator&#8217;s IP address or user agent instead of the comment poster&#8217;s when reporting a comment as spam).</p>\n<p>Finally, try to send unmodified data if you can.  Most applications will transform content with formatting and markup.  It&#8217;s best to send Akismet the original content, prior to formatting, if you can.</p>\n<h3>Test with live comments</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to test with a significant amount of real live data if you want to draw any conclusions about accuracy.  We often hear from developers who have made a handful of API calls using imitation comments they&#8217;ve written themselves, and who aren&#8217;t seeing the results they expect.  This is because Akismet works by comparing comments to genuine spam activity that is happening right now (and it does so based on more than just the content).  An artificially constructed test spam comment probably won&#8217;t have much in common with real spam, so Akismet correctly returns a negative response.</p>\n<p>The best way to measure Akismet&#8217;s accuracy is with a feed of live data from your production servers.  Don&#8217;t act on its responses yet, just log the results to a file or store them in your metadata for analysis.  Examine the results, or compare them with another filtering method, and decide if they are acceptable.  Systematic errors usually indicate a data issue, so if you notice any oddities then <a href="https://akismet.com/contact/">please tell us</a> &#8211; we can probably suggest ways of improving accuracy.</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/738/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/738/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=738&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 20 Jul 2012 02:33:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Internet Defense League";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=41372";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://ma.tt/2012/07/internet-defense-league/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:184:"<p><a href="http://torrentfreak.com/bat-signal-heralds-launch-of-internet-defense-league-120719/">Bat-Signal Heralds Launch of Internet Defense League</a>.

Many WordPress installs are customized, and it&#8217;s really helpful to have a centralized resource for documenting those features. You can create documents about creating content, editing content, moderating comments, or whatever you want! If you have clients who can&#8217;t seem to remember how to do X, you should install WP Help and document it for them. WP Help is powered by WordPress Custom Post Types, so you create content using the full WordPress editor.</p>\n<h3>Document Syncing</h3>\n<p>Oh yeah. This is the feature you&#8217;ve all been waiting for. If you have a standard set of help documents you want to use on multiple sites, this lets you do that. Create the documents, grab the (secret) sync URL for that site, and then plug that URL in to other sites. Those other sites will automatically pull down those documents, and keep them up-to-date (even handling new documents, deleted documents, renamed documents, and re-parented documents). Any internal links in the original document will be rewritten to be local to the destination WP Help install. So go ahead and use the WP internal linking functionality on your source site and know that those links will work on all the destination sites!</p>\n<h3>Menu Placement</h3>\n<p>The menu item for the help documents can now be placed in one of four locations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As a Dashboard submenu</li>\n<li>Top level, above the Dashboard</li>\n<li>Top level, below the Dashboard</li>\n<li>Top level, at the bottom</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You get a live preview of this (yeah, I know, super fancy).</p>\n<h3>Menu Name</h3>\n<p>The menu name (and page title) can be changed. Just doubleclick the page title, edit it, and hit return. Boom. Again, this has a live preview.</p>\n<h3>Topics List Name</h3>\n<p>Likewise the topics list header can be renamed. Doubleclick, edit, return. Live preview.</p>\n<h3>Edit Links &amp; Management Links</h3>\n<p>If you can edit help documents, you&#8217;ll get an edit link. When editing, there is a handy &#8220;Manage&#8221; link to jump you back to the documents management interface. Navigating in general has been improved quite a bit.</p>\n<h3>Dashboard Widget</h3>\n<p>There is now a simple dashboard widget, listing all of your help documents.</p>\n<h3>Better Default Access</h3>\n<p>A lot of you said that you have Contributor-level users who need documentation just like authors do. So now they can view documentation by default (there&#8217;s a hook if you want to change the capability required to view help documents).</p>\n<h3>Lots of Little Tweaks</h3>\n<p>There are numerous little tweaks to improve your experience. <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-help/">Check out out</a>!</p>\n<h3>Roadmap</h3>\n<p>Things I&#8217;m considering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restricting individual documents to users with a certain level of access</li>\n<li>Multiple sync sources</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any other ideas?</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3894/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3894/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=3894&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:05:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"Weblog Tools Collection: What do you blog for?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11685";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/7NXPEcJbDwA/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:659:"<p>Sure, folks blog for many things, but that usually boils down into two main categories, personal reasons or business reasons.

Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their &#8220;projects&#8221; were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href="http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212;

Here I will touch on the converse &#8211; how to make sure your plugin will work nicely if it is loaded by a theme.</p>\n<p>My general approach to development is to create discreet features that can interact with each other in elegant ways. By keeping each set of features small, they are simpler by design and implementation &#8211; this makes both them less prone to bugs and easier to reuse. You can see this approach in action in many of <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/">Crowd Favorite&#8217;s WordPress products</a>. For example we created our <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui">Admin Post Formats UI</a> as a library that can be easily reused rather than coding that feature into our FavePersonal theme directly.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Another example, <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington-build/">Carrington Build</a> includes a plugin to enables translation of it&#8217;s data when being pushed from staging to production by <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/">RAMP</a>.</p>\n<p>If you start with the mindset of &#8220;I&#8217;m creating code to implement a feature, and this code should be as re-usable as possible&#8221;, then you&#8217;re already in good shape.</p>\n<p>Here are some specific things to consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use activation or deactivation hooks.</strong> There are actually lots of reasons why these are a bad idea, including multi-site considerations, upgrade considerations, etc. Instead, pick an opportune time to do a lightweight check to see if your plugin set-up needs to be run (perhaps check the existence of one of your settings &#8211; perhaps an &#8220;installed version&#8221; setting) and do the work you need to do at that time. Remember, you want to do these checks in admin hooks rather than front-end hooks &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to add unnecessary overhead to every public page load and you want to avoid race conditions.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t reply on your code running prior to all code being loaded.</strong> Hook in at <code>wp_loaded</code> (previously this was done at <code>init</code>) to do any set-up work, etc. The only situation where this might not be possible is if you need to <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2012/07/09/include-plugin-in-wordpress-theme#comment-220953">override a pluggable function</a>, but the types of plugins that need to do this are (in my experience) less likely to be the type of plugin included in a theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t rely on settings existing in the database.</strong> This ties in with the first consideration as I often see default settings written to the database as part of the activation process. I take the approach of creating an accessor function in my plugin that holds a set of defaults for settings. Here&#8217;s some example code:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/3079382">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that all <a href="http://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP sites</a> load plugins by including them within the theme code. If you&#8217;re writing code that might end up on this infrastructure, you&#8217;ll be glad that you followed the steps above.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\nSame with the Colors feature, Carrington Core, etc.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id="fn:2">\nRunning in the admin reduces the risk of this, but doesn&#8217;t negate it.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 20:23:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WordPress.tv: Ira Pasternack, Milan Cole, & Sara Tetreault: SEO Discussion";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=12313";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wordpress.tv/2012/07/11/ira-pasternack-milan-cole-sara-tetreault-seo-discussion/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:646:"<div id="v-OSPTwcjS-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/12313/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/12313/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=12313&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2012/07/11/ira-pasternack-milan-cole-sara-tetreault-seo-discussion/"><img alt="seo discussion" src="http://videos.videopress.com/OSPTwcjS/seo-discussion_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 11 Jul 2012 19:43:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Leah";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress 3.5 Underway with Promotions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11691";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/p4Sj7XzyO7k/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1670:"<p>Development for WordPress 3.5 is <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/07/11/recognition-and-news-about-the-3-5-cycle/">underway</a> as the core development team engage in their first scope session today.

This is the first major feature release of RAMP, and we added a bunch of great features.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most useful user feature is the &#8220;quick send&#8221; feature.

We made significant improvements to Extras callbacks to allow standalone comparison data, and we released a fully documented RAMP plugin skeleton and an example plugin. The RAMP process is somewhat complex, so hopefully these examples will help other developers extend RAMP for their needs. We also added a developer package that includes support for unlimited sites.</p>\n<p>We also added support for non-public post types by default, improved the error checking for staging/production server connection issues and made a variety of changes for WordPress 3.4 compatibility.</p>\n<p>If you are working on a WordPress site where you need to maintain staging and production environments, RAMP may be a solution for you.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 10 Jul 2012

Most importantly we did it in a way that still allows the Social plugin to be installed and updated independently. We made sure that we implemented this in a manner that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>respected users&#8217; expectations</li>\n<li>allowed users to manage the plugin independently of the theme</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I thought it might be useful to outline the approach we used in a little detail in case others might want to do something similar.</p>\n<p>At <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> we believe strongly in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a>. WordPress users expect to be able to download and install plugins whenever they see something that looks interesting. We wanted to make sure that we didn&#8217;t impede this process. So even though FavePersonal includes the Social plugin, we wanted to make sure we accounted for situations where Social was already installed on a site before FavePersonal was activated; as well as handling a situation where someone installs and activates the Social plugin once FavePersonal is already installed.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Foundation</h2>\n<p>When including a plugin in a theme, the main thing you want to avoid is a situation where the same PHP code is processed twice. This will trigger a fatal error (often times resulting in the white screen of death). In other words, don&#8217;t just <code>include()</code> the plugin in your theme. If someone already has that plugin activated on their site, you&#8217;d have the &#8220;loaded twice&#8221; issue (and your site would crash).</p>\n<p>To avoid this situation, it&#8217;s useful to look at the WordPress load process (in wp-settings.php, referencing WP 3.4.1). The first thing WordPress does is <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L108">load in its core functionality</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Load most of WordPress.\nrequire( ABSPATH . WPINC . ''/class-wp-walker.php'' );\nrequire( ABSPATH . WPINC . ''/class-wp-ajax-response.php'' );\nrequire( ABSPATH . WPINC . ''/formatting.php'' );\nrequire( ABSPATH . WPINC . ''/capabilities.php'' );\nrequire( ABSPATH . WPINC . ''/query.php'' );\nrequire( ABSPATH . WPINC . ''/theme.php'' );\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is followed by the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L160">loading of MU (Must Use) plugins</a>; these are plugins that are placed into the wp-content/mu-plugins directory and cannot be managed from the Plugins screen.</p>\n<pre><code>// Load must-use plugins.\nforeach ( wp_get_mu_plugins() as $mu_plugin ) {\n    include_once( $mu_plugin );\n}\nunset( $mu_plugin );\n</code></pre>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see the standard plugins loaded <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L196">on line 196</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Load active plugins.\nforeach ( wp_get_active_and_valid_plugins() as $plugin )\n    include_once( $plugin );\nunset( $plugin );\n</code></pre>\n<p>and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L282">on line 282</a> you&#8217;ll see the theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file loaded, along with any parent theme (if your theme is a child theme):</p>\n<pre><code>// Load the functions for the active theme, for both parent and child theme if applicable.\nif ( ! defined( ''WP_INSTALLING'' ) || ''wp-activate.php'' === $pagenow ) {\n    if ( TEMPLATEPATH !== STYLESHEETPATH &amp;&amp; file_exists( STYLESHEETPATH . ''/functions.php'' ) )\n        include( STYLESHEETPATH . ''/functions.php'' );\n    if ( file_exists( TEMPLATEPATH . ''/functions.php'' ) )\n        include( TEMPLATEPATH . ''/functions.php'' );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L290">Right after that</a>, you&#8217;ll see the following action:</p>\n<pre><code>do_action( ''after_setup_theme'' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Ok, now we have all the bits of the process we need to understand to properly conditionally include a plugin from a theme. So let&#8217;s do it.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Since the theme is loading in last, we can use that to our advantage. If the plugin has been installed separately as a plugin (and not as part of the theme), we will be able to see that it is active. If it is already active, we don&#8217;t want to load it again a second time.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/3060451">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>In our FavePersonal theme we added an additional check in the <code>if</code> statement to see if the setting to activate the Social plugin was turned on. This allows us to avoid loading the plugin if the site owner has decided to disable this functionality.</p>\n<p>There you have it &#8211; very simple, the plugin will only be loaded by the theme if it hasn&#8217;t been activated separately as a plugin, and the plugin is properly in place before <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L302"><code>init</code></a> or <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L323"><code>wp_loaded</code></a> (where plugins commonly do set-up work).</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\nOr perhaps a situation where someone: activates the FavePersonal theme, finds that they like the features of Social, changes to a new theme and installs/activates the Social plugin, then switches back to the FavePersonal theme (while the Social plugin is still active).&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1"

looks like after <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/forum/themes-templates/494-standard-theme-hook-names.html">three years since the discussion took place on the WPTavern forums</a> regarding the standardization of theme hooks, Doug Stewart has decided to put together a <a href="https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance">Theme Hook Alliance project</a> to get theme authors all on the same page. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Child theme authors and plugin developers need a consistent set of entry points to allow for easy customization and altering of functionality. Core WordPress offers a suite of [action hooks](<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/">http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/</a>) and [template tags](<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_tags">http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_tags</a>) but does not cover many of the common use cases. The Theme Hook Alliance is a community-driven effort to agree on a set of third-party action hooks that THA themes pledge to implement in order to give that desired consistency.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how far this goes and what the adoption rate will be like. Doug is looking for some feedback so if you&#8217;re keen to the idea, let him know in the comments of his blog post. </p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/gUS1wSHqEWY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 06 Jul 2012 10:15:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: New Site Dedicated To Reviewing WordPress Plugins";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6613";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:111:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/3gujwBvYkhI/new-site-dedicated-to-reviewing-wordpress-plugins";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:959:"<p><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpnuggetslogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpnuggetslogo.png" alt="wpnuggets logo" title="wpnuggetslogo" width="256" height="58" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6614" /></a> For those of you looking for in-depth reviews of both paid and free WordPress plugins, you may want to add <a href="http://wpnuggets.com/">WPNuggets.com</a> to your feedreader or bookmarks.

The last three will happen in October and November.\n\nIt feels like the collaboration between these two approaches  is something that is changing right now more than ever before. As a part of UnitedVisualArtists, the crossover (grey area?) between art, architecture and design is a topic that comes up all the time, and it''s an area that i''m personally very interested in exploring.

What''s the advantage of bringing these quite different concepts of space together?\n\nPeter Anders:\nPeople don''t realize that it''s actually a very old thing. There''s a lot of innovation that''s going on in the technologies right now, but few of us understand why that technology is being driven forward the way it is, and why it''s had the success that it''s had in the media. I think all of us grew up with fairytales and myths, and ... sort of narrative spaces that merge physical reality and imagined spaces, and imagined people together. And I think that virtual reality, or augmented reality, which is what my topic is, merges physical and non-physical in a similar sort of way.\n\nSabine Breitsameter:\nCould you give a description: How does this experience work?\n\nPeter Anders:\nThere''s a book, actually, that I wrote, called "Envisioning Cyberspace", and my topic of research in that book was the way we use space to think, and how that would influence the design of information environments. And from my standpoint, and of course I''m bringing along the baggage of architecture, as well, but we use space to think, in the sense that we construct the space that we see. We think that we are in a room, in this case a fairly confined recording studio, but in fact, all we really have to prove that is our sensory input, and everything from the senses is processed and used as this illusion. And of that course, makes mute that there is a reality, versus a not-reality or virtuality.

One wall forms the door, which the customer can make opaque for privacy during changing or clear to show off a garment to someone outside the booth. Another wall incorporates a "magic mirror," a camera and display that adds a four-second delay so the customer can spin around and view all sides of the garment. The opposite wall has two interactive closets, one for hanging clothes and one with shelves. Sensors in the closets detect the electronic tags on store items and trigger a touch screen that displays the item and its related information, from availability to permutations of color, fabric, and size\n\n', 'Rem Koolhaas &amp; IDEO - Interactive dressing rooms', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'rem-koolhaas-ideo-interactive-dressing-rooms', '', '', '2005-08-06 13:44:34', '2005-08-06 12:44:34', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=43', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The motor then determines to what extent the plastic strips that make up the lamp’s “petals” are opened or closed. The lamp only opens when the occupier is restrained in their power consumption — if too much is used it closes again.\n\nThis is just one of the many imaginative prototypes that are being developed by the Swedish Interactive Institute’s research project called <a href="http://www.tii.se/static/">Static</a>! in which designers, engineers and artists use design to solve energy issues.\n\n<img src="wp-content/imagebank/bubbel_lampa.jpg" alt="interactive architecture" />\n\nThe Bubble Lamp designed by Front is a paper lampshade that “bubbles” when the lamp is switched on visually demonstrating how energy is being released.\n\n', 'Kinetic Lighting - Front &amp; the Interactive Institute', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '54', '', '', '2005-09-23 19:58:58', '2005-09-23 18:58:58', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=54', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Second Skin turns this trajectory around, seeking a process of emergent design. Second Skin starts by examining patterns, qualia and structures seated within the unconscious that relate to conception of shelter and dwelling.\n\n<img src="http://www.lutyens.net/Projects/skinn/second%20skin/3dmodels/big/valefrenteazul.jpg" alt="interactive architecture" />\n\nThese modules of mental processing are coaxed out through an application of a hypnotic induction technique and projected into the terrain of architecture. The Second Skin is an architectural space that corresponds to an enlarged self, that comprises aspects of memory, brain function and deeply rooted notions of protection and shelter. Essentially, Second Skin uses the processes of mind as a model for architectural approaches and at the same time uses architecture as a metaphor for housing the collective space of mind.\n\nEach student listens to a trance-inducing audio track that is designed to evert architecturally based forms from the unconscious. The students draw their impressions on paper in a trance state, and record a detailed description of their impressions, such as specific qualities relating to size, form, structure, materials, viewpoint, kinaesthetic and proprioceptive experiences related to their own Second Skin.\n\n<img src="http://www.lutyens.net/Projects/skinn/second%20skin/3dmodels/big/DSCN0029g.jpg" alt="interactive Architecture" width="450" />\n\nThe next stage of the project involves everting this information into a format that can be objectively assessed, mapped, processed and reconfigured. The aim is to build a model of an intratypical dwelling, or in short, a structure that emerges and evolves from a morphing and merging of a collective of intratypes.\n\n<a href="http://www.lutyens.net/secondskin.htm">Website</a>\n\nalso visit<a href="http://www.artbrain.org/gallery3/secondskin/#"> ArtBrain for an article about the project</a> written by Tania Lopez Winkler.\n\n\n\n', 'Second Skin -  Lutyens &amp; Winkler', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'second-skin-lutyens-winkler', '', '', '2005-09-24 19:56:02', '2005-09-24 18:56:02', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=53', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Central to Price’s practice was the belief that through the correct use of new technology the public could have unprecedented control over their environment, resulting in a building which could be responsive to visitors’ needs and the many activities intended to take place there.\n\nAs the marketing material suggested, there was a wide choice of activities: “Choose what you want to do – or watch someone else doing it. Learn how to handle tools, paint, babies, machinery, or just listen to your favourite tune. Dance, talk or be lifted up to where you can see how other people make things work. Sit out over space with a drink and tune in to what’s happening elsewhere in the city. Try starting a riot or beginning a painting – or just lie back and stare at the sky.”\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/fun_palace.jpg" />\n\nUsing an unenclosed steel structure, fully serviced by travelling gantry cranes the building comprised a ‘kit of parts’: pre-fabricated walls, platforms, floors, stairs, and ceiling modules that could be moved and assembled by the cranes.

Its central theme is the magical relationship of speech to the ethereal medium which conveys it. Participants in Hidden Worlds are able to "see" each others'' voices, which are made visible in the form of animated graphic figurations that appear to emerge from the participants'' mouths while they speak. In the installation, visitors wear special see-through data glasses, which register and superimpose 3D graphics into the real world. When one of the users speaks or sings, colorful abstract forms appear to emerge from his or her mouth. The graphics representing these utterances assume a wide variety of shapes and behaviors that are tightly coupled to the unique qualities of the vocalist''s volume, pitch and timbre.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hiddenworld3.jpg" />\n\n<strong>RE:MARK</strong> is an installation for two participants which likewise presents an interactive visualization of its users'' speech. Unlike Hidden Worlds, which primarily attends to the noiselike aspects of vocal sounds, RE:MARK shifts this inquiry towards the more symbolic domain of the spoken and written word.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/remark_installation.jpg" />\n\nIn RE:MARK, sounds spoken into a pair of microphones are analyzed and classified by a phoneme recognition system. When a phoneme is recognized with sufficient confidence, the written name of the phoneme (for example, oh, ee, ah, etc.) is projected on the installation''s display. If the user''s sound is not recognized by the system''s classifier, then an abstract shape is generated instead, based directly on the timbral characteristics of the vocalization.\n\n<img src="http://www.flong.com/remark/rmark/DSCN0867.jpg" width="400" />\n\nAs the visitor speaks, the corresponding written phonemes and abstract forms are rendered as silhouettes, and appear to emerge from the shadow of the speaker''s head.

The novelty is the ubiquity of the technology in the space, without involving the visitor in complicated, technical ways of interacting with the technology. Instead the modes of interaction are modelled on existing notions of exploring an environment, like a fashion store.\n\nTechnology events in the ReFashion Lab can therefore be understood as an augmentation, or extension of existing real-world experiences. Physical space, artefacts and visitors are essentially joined into new conceptual entities through the use of digital media in a location and time specific, interactive context.\n\nThe prototype space offered an opportunity to assess those possible new relationships between people, interactive media and physical world.\n\nThe part of the project I most like is MetaMirror built but Tomato Interactive (UK). The MetaMirror is a special installation, overlaying natural reflections with digital media imagery and information.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/metamirror.jpg" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/metamirror2.jpg" />\n\nIt plugs into a special media infrastructure, linking space, artefact and media into one entity. The system operating behind the enabled space is able to identify and locate specific items being carried inside. It can then react automatically with a variety of custom events.\nThis works by tagging the fashion items with a special radio chip, that allows the individual items to be recognised in the space. If a visitor is wearing the item, the space can therefore react with custom experiences relating to the behaviour and movement of the individual.\n\nThe MetaMirror is a large scale animated display, that features a video clip looping over the entire surface of the Mirror. Once a visitor is approaching the display, the animation is faded out to turn the pane into a real mirror. Above the persons reflection though, the mirror is showing images and information relating to the item being worn. The material effect of linking reflection and projection into one image is produced by using a special semi-transparent mirror with a strong back projection.\n\nThe cognitive issue of linking the presented information event with the artefact carried by the visitor is a challenge to interaction design, but also opens an interesting debate on the further scope of these application in other contexts.

Buckminster Fuller, 1980\n\nEvery so often I like to highlight a few of the truely inspirational characters of Interactive Architecture from long before there were such things as CAD/CAM, or parametric design, or even microchips. After posting my last blog about the new nano composite material ''Buckypaper'' and ''Bucky I felt that It was about time I gave Buckminster Fuller a post of his own and to be fair he deserves more that just one post because in his life time his work as an architect, inventor, engineer, mathamatican, poet and cosmologist created 28 patents including... Stockade (1927), 4D House  (1928), Dymaxion Car (1937), Dymaxion House,  Geodesic Dome (1954), Paperboard Dome (1959), and then many more geometric marvels.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/buckbuilding.jpg" />\n\nFuller never got an Architectural degree and in fact didn''t even get a license until he was awarded one as an honor when he was in his late 60s. This did not prevent him from designing the geodesic dome: the only kind of building that can be set on the ground as a complete structure--and with no limiting dimension. The strength of the frame actually increases in ratio to its size, enclosing the largest volume of space with the least area of surface. This was his virtuoso invention, and he said it illustrated his strategy of "starting with wholes" rather than parts.\n\n Three<strong> Dymaxion Cars</strong> were constructed in 1933 and 1934, pioneering many significant automotive design innovations. These included front-wheel drive, rear engine and rear steering, and aerodynamic streamlining.\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/dymaxioncar.jpg" />\n\nFullers <strong>4D House </strong>1928\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/4dhouse.jpg" width="450"/>\n\n\n<strong>Triton City</strong>\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/sub.jpg"/>\nIn the early 1960''s a design for a floating city for Tokyo Bay was commissioned.

A partnership between two German firms, carpet maker Vorwerk Teppichwerke and semiconductor specialist Infineon Technologies has created a ''Thinking Carpet'', equipped with sensors able to manage a range of control functions in the office of the future\n\nFor instance, pressure sensors can report an alarm as soon as people enter a security zone. In the process, intelligent software solutions are able to analyse the signals, even individually. Thus an alarm is triggered, for example, only when traces of movement commence on a window or an emergency exit, but not at free-access entrances. Security zones can be individually defined and individually controlled on a time-frame basis as well. As soon as registered signals are additionally relayed to a security control centre, the point of alarm (break-in or fire) can be localised precisely in a matter of seconds. Besides this, pressure sensors in the carpet can also be utilised as door-openers and light switches, or as electronic counters for people, too.\n\nIn combination with shatterproof LED modules, the ''Thinking Carpet'' also becomes a controllable guidance system. For example, in this case light-emitting diodes in the carpet mark the shortest route to an emergency exit. The combination of different sensory functions (pressure, temperature and motion) can additionally enable the detection of people lying motionless on the floor, triggering a call for emergency help.\n\nfrom <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/004530.php#trackbacks">wmmna</a>', 'Clever Carpets', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'clever-carpets', '', '', '2005-11-14 10:35:24', '2005-11-14 09:35:24', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=90', 0, 'post', '', 1),

A total of 26 industrial Festo muscles are intergraded into the spiralling structure to control the physical movement of the MuscleBody. The skin is further composed of Lycra, a stretchable fabric normally used for sports clothing. The translucency of the fabric varies according to the degree of stretching. The fabric is fitted in segments that are slightly offset to the tubular structure. The thin strips of light that occur between the tubing and the skin in combination with the altering translucency of the fabric itself results in a play of light when the MuscleBody is activated.

They are also testing the hab to destruction by over-inflating the modules, with the resulting explosions contained in rigid test cages.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/inflatenasa2.jpg" />\n\nNautiluses could be flown as independent space stations or connected with a docking mechanism to make bigger hotels. Bigelow sees economies of scale as one of the keys to profitability, and plans to sell space hotels to rivals for $100 million each.\n\nIf all goes well with orbital tests of one-third-scale test modules to be launched late next year, Bigelow plans to launch the first habitable Nautilus in 2008, around the time SpaceDev expects the first private orbital flights to be happening.\n\nWhile Starzyk, for one, does not think commercial orbital vehicles will happen that soon, space flight has always been fuelled by dreamers daring to expect the impossible.

The plastic seating, embedded with LED (light-emitting diode) strips and sensors, measure the presence of people over time. Both the number of people sitting and the length of time they stay create a ''social interactive pattern'' that is translated by patented software into lighting effects in the furniture. Many people sitting for brief periods of time result in lighting activity expressing a busy period, whereas one or two people sitting for a longer period trigger mellow lighting.\n\nFrom <a href="http://www.rca.ac.uk/pages/news/glowing_places_is_going_2999.html">RCA</a>\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/phil2.jpg" />\n\nGlowing Places is built on Philips Designs research on the theme of the <a href="http://www.design.philips.com/about/design/section-12825/article-14530.html">''emotional building''</a> - a building that responds to the behavior and feelings of its users by visually expressing the activity inside.

Cyberspace, after all, is conceived as something like the astral plane--a digital reality that exists "elsewhere." But it''s precisely this "elsewhere" that''s being eroded by applications like Davison and Reid''s augmented reality system. Increasingly, the digital world is being married to the real world, with surprising results.\n\nMy personal theory is this: when the only way to use a computer was to sit still and look through a little window (the screen) into a virtual space, the cyberspace metaphor worked best for us. But with cell phones, PDAs and geographical applications such as store-finders and the proposed "taxi" key for cell phones (which simply summons the nearest cab when you press it), we''re no longer staring through a window into cyberspace.

The boundaries of the Square are defined by the 50 meter long facades of the Schloss Gallery and the Schloss with its newly constructed terraces. The "Energy Line”, a 70 meter long stainless steel-glass fiber band, goes beyond these boundaries. Beginning in the inner area of the Schloss Gallery near the now visible foundation stone shell, it cuts across the water basin in the square, steps up the bed and the edge of the terrace and ends in the rectangular limewood court. Thirty five sensor stones are strewn across the square and, like the Energy Line, glow in the night with a blue light. When a pedestrian crosses over one of the sensors, a change occurs in the water spray graphics with its 11 nozzles. The combination of each water nozzle, whether opened or closed, and the streams of water, either hard or gentle, enable 638,668,800 possible combinations. This means: each visitor to the square can produce a near unique water image.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/waterfountain3.jpg" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/waterfountain2.jpg" height="128" />\n\nThe everchanging graphic is accompanied by the flyer’s constant rhythm of movement.

Once again, all nozzles are turned off to "no water image” until a pedestrian reactivates the work by stepping over a sensor.

JP Aerospace is developing the technology to fly a balloonor more accurately, their relative, the airshipdirectly to orbit. Flying an airship directly from the ground to orbit is not practical. An airship large enough to reach orbit would not survive the winds near the surface of the Earth. Conversely, an airship that could fly from the ground to upper atmosphere would not be light enough to reach space. The resulting configuration is a three-part architecture for using lighter-than-air vehicles to reach space.’\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/jp3aerospace.jpg" />\n\nThis 3 part system begins with an ‘atmospheric’ airship which will travel from the surface of the Earth to 140,000 feet and meet with a suborbital space station, a permanent, crewed facility called the DSS (Dark Sky Station). It will be here that they build the orbital airship initially and then use the DSS as the departure port.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/jp2aerospace.jpg" />\n\n‘The third part of the architecture is an airship/dynamic vehicle that flies directly to orbit. In order to utilize the few molecules of gas at extreme altitudes, this craft is big. The initial test vehicle is 6,000 feet (over a mile) long. The airship uses buoyancy to climb to 200,000 feet. From there it uses electric propulsion to slowly accelerate. As it accelerates it dynamically climbs. Over several days it reaches orbital velocity.’\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/jpaerospace.jpg" />\n\n‘The high altitude airship has been built and is awaiting test flights. Several Dark Sky Station platforms have been built and flown. Every piece of equipment for this system has been carried to 100,000 feet and tested in the environment.

But events like the Neuroaesthetics conference here in London , along with the increasing impact of neuroscience on contemporary architectural theory, marks a clear change of interests -- if not a paradigm shift. Significantly, the then almost ubiquitous word "virtual" is now being replaced by "neuro." What is happening?\n\n<em>Brian Massumi</em>\n\nThe introduction of digital techniques into architecture, and the preoccupation with the virtual that came with it, brought up some very old questions with a new intensity. The change came at a time when the idea of "virtual reality" was very current in popular culture and had a major presence in the mass media. "Virtual reality" was used as a synonym for "artificial reality." There was something of an apocalyptic tone to many commentaries, to the effect that the new generation of digital technology was creating a technological cocoon around human beings that would separate them from any direct access to the world, and would denature human relations.\n\nThe old questions that took on new urgency had to do with the relation between nature and culture. Digital techniques in architecture added a new twist that changed the terms in which this question could be asked...

The elevator will be anchored to an offshore sea platform near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, and to a small counterweight in space. Mechanical lifters (robotic elevator cars) will move up and down the ribbon, carrying such items as satellites, solar power systems, and eventually people into space.

I personally didn''t find anything that was mindblowingly new but it was good to talk to some of the people in this industry and discuss the future uses of these materials.\n\nAn obvious way to start an overview of Smart Materials should be to provide a definition of Smart Materials. However, beyond the completely accurate but not too useful, "a material that displays smart behaviour" that is easier said than accomplished. To define a Smart Material we really need to understand what is meant by Smart behaviour and then, by means of some examples, to develop our definition.\n\nSmart behaviour occurs when a material can sense some stimulus from its environment and react to it in a useful, reliable, reproducible and usually reversible manner. A really Smart material will use its reaction to the external stimulus to initiate or actuate an active response, e.g. with an active control system. Whilst this is perhaps a more useful definition examples from familiar items would help at this point.\n\nThere are some materials that are designed to change their colour at a particular temperature. They find uses in bath plugs that show when the bath water is too hot, children’s feeding spoons and coffee or tea mugs. Gromit’s nose on the PG Tips mug is a very recent example. Technically this is described as "thermochromic" behaviour where a thermal stimulus causes a useful optical response.\n\nSmart behaviour is therefore the reaction of a material to some change in its environment, no material can be Smart in isolation, it must be a part of a structure or system such as the bath plug, the spoon or the coffee mug.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/oricalco_shirt.jpg" />\n\nAnother interesting heat responsive material is <a href="http://www.gzespace.com/">Oricalco</a>\n\nThis men''s shirt by Corpo Nova is woven with titanium, which allows the fabric to react to temperature shifts. The shirt holds its wrinkles when bunched up, and then instantly relaxes when exposed to a current of hot air (as from an electric hair dryer). The shirt can thus be ''ironed'' while its user wears it.\n\nHere''s a project at MIT using Smart Materials I really love called Puddlejumper\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/puddlejumper.jpg" />\n\nPuddlejumper is a luminescent raincoat that glows in the rain. Hand-silkscreened electroluminescent lamps on the front of the jacket are wired to interior electronics and conductive water sensors on the back and left sleeve. When water hits one of the sensors, the corresponding lamp lights up, creating a flickering pattern of illumination that mirrors the rhythm of rainfall.\n\nmore on Smart Materials soon to come...', 'Smart Materials 1 - Definition', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'smart-materials-1-definition', '', '', '2006-01-20 10:59:31', '2006-01-20 09:59:31', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=150', 0, 'post', '', 4),

Not pollen or seeds but plastic yellow tubes are used as the basic material of this new nature.'' He talked about how protein acts as the key element in the structure and functioning of all living cells and that he wanted to use his own protein (plastic tubes) to act as the building block for his very own creations.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/theo6.jpg" />\n\nStarting out initially on his Atari STe, he programmed evolving species that tested how to build walking legs from 7 varying lengths and through natural selection was able to find quite accurate measurements of the perfect ratio of configuration.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/theo4.jpg" />\n\nThe next stage in the evolution of these creature’s mechanics was to build prototypes using just the plastic tubes and test them in real world environments.

"We can do the whole state with three balloons."\n\nIf successful, the hydrogen-filled balloons could be drifting across the stratosphere above North Dakota this summer, providing cellular coverage at a tiny fraction of the cost of building cellular towers.

See the <a href="?p=143">Space Lift</a> and the <a href="?p=156">Flying Radio Towers</a> so while it may not be specifically interactive architecture, I thought I''d share these fascinating new approaches to sustainable power generation.\n\nWind turbines are constantly getting taller because everyone knows the higher you get off the ground, the better the wind speeds. But building big towers is expensive, especially if you want one 15,000 feet tall. So why not ditch the tower and make the windmill fly?\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/windpower1.jpg" />\n<em>"Sky Windpower"</em>\n\nSeveral people are trying to do that. They''ve been written about before by others, but we''ve yet to tackle them, so here''s a little round-up of the three most notable projects: Sky Windpower, Laddermill, and Magenn. Each is a bit sketchy, but deserves to be given a shot. It seems obvious that once someone creates a workable system, it will become a huge winner, because of the sheer amount of power available up high: 1% of the jetstream''s wind power could supply all US electrical demand. Also, one of the main complaints about wind power is its intermittency--the wind doesn''t blow all the time, and so (according to Sky Windpower), most wind farms are only operating at their peak capacity 19-35% of the time. The wind is much steadier at altitude, so you get even more advantage over ground-based wind power. A final advantage is ad-hoc generation: devices with a reasonably simple tether-system do not have to be permanently installed in one place, they could be trucked out to any location that needed them.\n\n\n<a href="http://www.skywindpower.com/ww/index.htm">Sky Windpower</a> is the furthest along, with functional prototypes tested in the field. According to their figures, one flying windmill rated at 240kW with rotor diameters of 35 feet could generate power for less than two cents per kilowatt hour--that would make them the cheapest power source in the world. The flying windmills would initially get in position under their own power, using their motors to drive the propeller blades and helicopter upwards until they reached altitude. Then the motors would turn off and become generators as wind pushes the propeller blades, and the whirligig would float instead of fall because when tethered, the lift generated by the wind would overcome the craft''s weight as it also generates power.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/windpower2.jpg" />\n<em>Magenn</em>\n\n<a href="http://www.magenn.com/">Magenn</a> is a more modest design, which makes it more feasible. The inventor is Fred Ferguson, a Canadian engineer specializing in airships. He envisions a range of devices from the household scale. Magenn''s design is radically different from other windmills on the market--it would not use propeller blades. Instead, it would be a helium blimp, with Savonius-style scoops causing it to rotate around motors at the attachment-points to its tether. The blimp-like design has several advantages: its Savonius scoop design lets it operate in winds as low as 2 mph; it is safer in a crash, because it would fall slowly and be mostly made of flexible material; it is safer for airplanes, because it sits below legally usable airspace; it is safer for birds, because the moving parts are visible and travel with the wind. The critic''s valid point is that the devices are currently vaporware, with not even a working prototype built yet. Despite this, Magenn has a distribution partner lined up, once they do get into production. It looks like the power-blimps would be mechanically simple and easy to build, so I would give them good odds of pulling it off by the end of the year, as promised. But it will no doubt take a few years before their invention is optimized and debugged.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/windpower3.jpg" />\n<em>Magenn Details</em>\n\n<a href="http://www.laddermill.com/">Laddermill</a> was a research project at TU Delft in the Netherlands. They imagined a series of kites strung together by cables into a loop hundreds of meters--possibly even a few kilometers--high. The kites would be computer-controlled to change their attitude and generate more lift from the wind on one side of the loop than the other. This would cause the entire loop to rotate, and its rotation would push a generator down on the ground to create electricity.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/windpower4.gif" />\n\nIt sounds ludicrous, but the folks at TU Delft are smart, and we need to seriously investigate more out-of-the-box approaches. In some ways, this design is simpler than Magenn or Sky Windpower because it does not have to have the power-generation equipment aloft, and does not require a power-carrying tether, just a mechanical one. The elimination of power-generation hardware from the flying parts of the device also means that it should be safer, because the bits that can crash are small and light. I havent been able to find any information however on its development in the last 2 years so I''m unsure if its still being investigated.\n\nConcept <a href="http://www.ockels.nl/ArtworkFrame.htm">Videos & Images</a> of Laddermill\n\nvia <a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/">world changing</a>', 'Flying Wind Turbines', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'flying-wind-turbines', '', '', '2006-02-09 12:52:58', '2006-02-09 11:52:58', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=160', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This kind of shared view is a powerful aid to cooperative understanding, but it is most successful if it is robust, accessible, dynamic, editable. Computer displays, even large ones, have never adequately answered these needs.\n\nAccenture have built a commercially available interactive wall using a very large, high-resolution  display that is touch-sensitive. Its applications can handle interactions from multiple users, acting simultaneously.\n\nThe Accenture Technology Labs has created a scalable architecture which can support Walls of any size and resolution. "We use a series of commodity PCs and software parallelism rather than proprietary fusion hardware for higher performance at lower cost." The natural parallelism of the system allows for full workstation performance across the entire Wall. Applications might feature complex CAD models, high-resolution video, interactive simulations, game graphics, or all of the above.\n\nTo draw the pixels, various display solutions are possible, from stackable cube style monitors to tiled-projection displays. To detect user touch, the Labs has developed its own camera-based touch system, which operates at a very large scale with a fine degree of resolution.

The installation rendered the listed parquet floor into a sensitive surface, so that as people walked, they caused fluctuations in light and triggered sounds in the space. The idea corresponds to the past and present usage of the space; which was built as a grand ballroom and now serves as a space for theatre, dance and exhibitions. Following the symmetry and pattern of the rococo architecture, an interactive electronic system was integrated with the interior so that it is hardly noticeable to the visitor. It operated as an oversized electronic circuit, designed to metamorphose any micro vibrations within the space. The salon of the ch&acirc;teau became a reactive space that was stirred by those who moved within it. &lsquo;Atteindre le silence&#39; is a work that asks people to be still. As people moved, any vibrations on the floor manifestly shifted electrical voltages around the space. The force, duration and location of vibrations coming from the ballroom floor determined the sound oscillations in space and altered the intensity of the light pulses coming from the chandeliers.</p> <p align="left">Bruit rose</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hehe3.jpg" alt="interactive architecture" /></p> <p align="left">Bruit rose (Pink noise in English) is a musical term that describes a random electronic noise across all sound frequencies which sounds tolerable for the human ear.

The body senses the activities of the people and interacts with the players in a multimodal way. The public discovers within minutes how the MUSCLE behaves on their actions, and soon after they start finding a goal in the play.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/musclensa2.jpg" />\n\nThe outcome of this interaction however is unpredictable, since the MUSCLE is programmed to have a will of its own. It is pro-active rather then responsive and obedient. The programmable body is played by its users. A constant play of conjointly effectuating (re)actions, of attraction and repulsion between all players involved. This game truly is a multi-player game. Now true communication is established, where the pro-active parties involved alternately sense, process, and actuate in this constant loop of mutual influence. The players experience this parametric game of architecture as a form of serious fun.

It is a generic responsive structural system, which adapts to isolated spatial requirements. The structure is capable of various transformations, which range from small-scale surface articulations to large surface deformations, which can generate temporary enclosures. Such a responsive structure can multiply. Intensify and vary the potential uses of public spaces, which usually rely on external intervention to host new activities. Sensors, input devices and wireless networks are integrated into normally dead building materials to transform architectural space into complex intelligent operating systems.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/topoten3.jpg" />\n\nThe programme mode automates the basic functions of the structure. Directly related to the specific event schedule of its environment It drives the generic transformations, initiating and locating the deformations that control the access and the circulation within the public spaces. It also generates small emergent temporary spaces, which host ancillary programmes related to ongoing events. Finally it enables certain tiles of the structure''s sheared surface to pivot and thus allow for temporarily different degrees of transparency within the structures spatial arrangement\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/topoten5.jpg" />\n\nThe crowd mode responds in real time to the movements and behavioural patterns of the visitors within the structure. It Influences the size, orientation and development of the temporary enclosures, previously established by the programme mode. Finally it affects the orientation of the surface''s tiles, based on the positions and sizes of the visitor crowds.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/topoten.jpg" />\n\nFinally the memory mode records, on a long-term basis, the paths and motion patterns chosen by Individual users, influencing the surface topography by indicating and levelling the most frequented parts. It defines the actual width of circulation spaces, temporary level connections, entrance areas and thresholds according to the number of visitors at every point in time during the period of use.\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/topoten6.jpg" />\n\nThese three parallel modes of operation run simultaneously and add up to the structure''s complex, unpredictable user-dependant spatial configuration. The constantly changing three-dimensional space envelope interacts with its visitors in a permanent feedback loop, where the users reactions to spatial adaptation are fed back into the system to in turn update the spatial arrangements and individually customize the built environment to requirements at any given moment for any given pattern of use.\n\n<a href="http://www.5subzero.org/5subzero.html">Website  </a>', 'Topotransegrity - Non-Linear Responsive Environments - Robert Neumayr', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'topotransegrity-non-linear-responsive-environments-robert-neumayr', '', '', '2006-04-12 23:51:06', '2006-04-12 22:51:06', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/topotransegrity-non-linear-responsive-environments-robert-neumayr.html', 0, 'post', '', 8),

He spoke about how their recent projects were exploiting real world data to start to develop adaptive and local specific artifacts from initially generic starting points.\n\nPhil describes the ability of a structure whether to biologically or artificially redefine and modify itself as being adaptive. ‘An adaptive system requires attributes of behavior, sensing and memory and then mechanisms of feedback allowing for these adaptive systems to construct themselves specifically for their environment increasing their local specificity over time.''\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/philayres6.jpg" />\n\nWhat was of most interest to me was how they built an iterative loop into this process so that rather than the design and construction being a linear process, it was a system of reiterations based on observations which as the cycles of the loops progressed created the possibility to build artifacts that were specific to local conditions of a site. Their most recent project is situated in the rich and varied landscape of Keilder (UK), containing a vast forest and the largest man made lake in Europe . Their research question - ‘The computer allows us to simulate living systems and their environments over time. With a bridge constructed between the worlds of the digital and physical through CAD/CAM, could notions of growth and adaptation act as mechanisms to drive the design, manufacture and life cycle of fragments or larger parts of the built environment.''\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/philforest.jpg" />\n\nThey have developed initally environmental drivers using temperture variation accross diurnal/nocturnal/seasonal cycles. These values are able to build up data sets of locally specific microclimates.

Each bion, measuring approximately 4×3x2 ½ inches is an synthetic “life-form” fitted with an audio speaker, blue lights (LED''s), and multiple sensors.

He has been working at the intersection 					of art and biology for over two decades working in the catagories 					of interactive robotics, biological art, artificial life, 					interspecies communication, rapid prototyping and digital 					imaging. Rinaldo teaches interactive robotic sculpture, 					digital imaging, multimedia and Directs the Art and Technology 					program in the Department of Art at The Ohio State University 					in Columbus Ohio.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/kenrinaldo2.jpg" alt="interactive architecture" title="Interactive Architecture" /></p> <p>It consists of fifteen robotic sound sculptures that interact with the public and modify their behaviors over time. These behaviors change based on feedback from infrared sensors, the presence of the participant/viewers in the exhibition and the communication between each separate sculpture. This series of robotic sculptures talk with each other through a computer network and audible telephone tones, which are a musical language for the group. Autopoiesis is &quot;self making&quot;, a characteristic of all living systems which was defined and refined by Francisco Varella and Humberto Maturana. The interactivity engages the viewer/participant who in turn, effects the system&#39;s evolution and emergence. This creates a system evolution as well as an overall group sculptural aesthetic.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/kenrinaldo3.jpg" alt="interactive architecture" title="Interactive Architecture" /></p> <p>In Autopoiesis the robotic sensors compare their sensor data through a central-state controller, so the viewer is able to walk through the sculptural installation and have the arms interact both individually and as a group. Because each arm has its own on-board computer control, the overall speed of reaction is rapid and therefore, life-like. Local control always supercedes group control when a local sensor is aware of a human nearby. This also allows individual arms to show accuracy and delicacy of approach and avoidance when encountering the viewer/participant. At the tip of two of the arms, lipstick cameras project what they see onto the walls of the space. This gives the viewer/participant a sense of being observed by this artificial life robotic sculpture.</p> <p>Also see Regine from wmmna&#39;s recent <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/008826.php">interview with Ken Rinaldo</a></p> <p>I&#39;ll put some more of Kens more recent work up soon&nbsp;</p>', 'Autopoesis', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'autopoesis', '', '', '2006-08-25 00:44:06', '2006-08-24 23:44:06', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/autopoesis.html', 0, 'post', '', 2),

They have created a space to experience the invisible body of the mobile phone. Flashing cells basically consist of one or more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">LEDs</a>, battery and a sensor that detects electromagnetic ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation">EM </a>) radiation transmitted by an active mobile phone. When the sensor detects EM waves it sets off the LEDs to flash for a couple of seconds. In general the flashing cells are enclosed in a plastic casing on a strap and sold as a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=flashing%20cell%20strap&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi">fashion accessory </a> for a mobile phone.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/mobile_phone_disco3.jpg" alt=" " /><br /> </p> <p>The Cell Phone Disco installation has two parts:</p> <p><strong>MOBILE AURA </strong>Flashing cells with sensors of higher sensitivity are used to detect electromagnetic radiation of active mobile phone in a range of approximately a meter. This way a sort of aura appears around the phone, revealing a part of it&#39;s invisible body. While the user moves around talking on his cell phone, this aura follows the conversation as a light shadow through the space.</p> <p><strong>MOBILE DRAWING </strong>Much less sensitive cells are used to create a canvas for an inkless marker. The LEDs get activated only by an extreme proximity of the electromagnetic source. Moving the phone close to the cells therefore leaves a trace of light, an electromagnetic drawing.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/mobile_phone_disco.jpg" alt=" " /></p> <p>via <a href="http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/008830.php">wmmna</a> &nbsp;</p>', 'Cell Phone Disco - informationlab', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'cell-phone-disco-informationlab', '', '', '2006-08-27 00:33:48', '2006-08-26 23:33:48', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/cell-phone-disco-informationlab.html', 0, 'post', '', 0),

It is a further development of his earlier well known <a href="http://www.haque.co.uk/skyear.php">Sky Ear</a> project where a non-rigid carbon-fibre structure, embedded with one thousand glowing helium balloons, mobile phones, sensor circuits and LEDs responsed to electromagnetic waves creating a floating &quot;cloud&quot; of light that revealed the natural electromagnetism of our environment, and also how our mobile phone calls and text messages delicately affect the new and existing electromagnetic fields.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/skyear.jpg" alt=" " width="200" height="150" /><br /> <em>Sky Ear 2004</em></p> <p class="description">Open Burble adopts the technology of Sky Ear but explores a more intuitive way to enable people to engage directly with the tactile experience of flying the cloud. &#39;Participants will divide into groups in order to assemble about 140 hexagonal &quot;clouds&quot; into a complete Burble, built to such a scale that, when inflated with helium, it will soar upwards like Jack&#39;s beanstalk.&#39;</p> <p class="description"><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/openburble3.jpg" alt=" " /><br /> <em>Building a module of Open Burble structure, the final construct will be 10 times as big</em></p> <p class="description">Just as the participants are the generators of the Burble&#39;s 60m tall form, so too are they the ones to control it. They hold on to it using handles with which they may position the Burble as they like. They may curve in on themselves, or pull it in a straight line - the form is a combination of the crowd&#39;s desires and the impact of wind currents varying throughout the height of the Burble. The Burble will move, rustle, tangle, fold in on itself and create turbulence as the wind catches it like a sail.

A smattering of moonlight falls upon the forest floor. Two mechanical snails move slowly through the darkness. They confront one another and briefly take the measure each others powers before uniting in love play. With mounting ecstasy, their transparent bodies begin to glow,but just before climax a dark shadow looms over them&#39;</p> <p>The <strong>Digital Music</strong> category was awarded to sound pioneer <a href="http://kalvos.org/radigue.html"><strong>Eliane Radigue</strong></a>  for a contemplative piece entitled <strong>&#39;L&icirc;Ie re-sonante.&#39;</strong></p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/ars7.jpg" alt=" " title="Interactive Architecture" width="450" height="301" /><br /> </p> <p>According to Eliane Radigue, L&icirc;Ie re-sonante (The Resonating Isle) was inspired by a moment in which the musician saw an island in a lake while the water reflected her face. Such an image is twoelements in one a real picture and an optical illusion. The depth of the water is reflected by thedeeper tones; the higher tones float above them like the island jutting out of the water.</p> <p>Eliane Radigue composes electro-acoustic music. In the early 50s, she was one of the pioneers of this genre (together with Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry). The same consistency and economy with which she works exclusively with an ARP synthesizer has characterized her musical mode of expression for decades. Lately, she has been discovered as a model by a younger generation of musicians.</p> <p><strong>Interactive Art</strong> winner was <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~demarini/"><strong>Paul DeMarinis</strong></a>  for his installation <strong>&#39;The Messenger&#39;</strong></p> <p>E-mails from all over the world are received by a computer and distributed to three systems of bizarre output devices that enable installation visitors to experience the messages sensorially. First, to 26 washbasins arrayed in a large oval; the number of basins is identical to the number of letters in the alphabet, and a different voice is assigned to each one. Built-in loudspeakers serially in tone the individual letters of the incoming e-mail.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/ars5.jpg" alt=" " title="Interactive Architecture" width="450" height="325" /><br /> </p> <p>Second, theres a chorus line of 26 dancing skeletons;each skeleton wears a small poncho prominently displaying one of the letters of the alphabet. The individual letters of the message activate the corresponding skeleton and the chorus lines dance reproduces the text of the e-mail.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/ars6.jpg" alt=" " title="Interactive Architecture" /><br /> </p> <p>And third, theres a series of 26 electrolytic jars with metalelectrodes in the form of the letters A to Z that oscillate and bubble when electricity is passed through them and let the letters of the e-mail glow in color.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/ars1.jpg" alt=" " title="Interactive Architecture" width="450" height="325" /></p> <p>The system stores no information and has no data processing capabilities. If the signals are not observed, written down and interpreted, then the installation is the end of the line for messages that had traveled around the world to meet their demise here. The installation thus becomes an allegory for messages whose final destination is a total void a phenomenon that has become a standard component of everyday life in the modern world. According to DeMarinis, The Messenger is based on early ideas about telegraphy and especially those of Catalan physician and naturalist Francesc Salva. He designed an output device for his telegraph equipment that involved an array of 26 servants who, following stimulation in the form of an electrical shock, would each call out a particular letter of the transmitted message, which could then be understood by a listener. The installation takes this as the point of departure for a consideration of the interrelationships between electricity and democracy, and how electronic communications technologies have led to loneliness and isolation just as they have contributed to the enrichment of our lives and experiences. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The Road Movie</strong> by the Japanese artists group <a href="http://www.exonemo.com/RM/index.html"><strong>exonemo</strong></a>  takes the Golden Nica in the <strong>Net Vision category</strong>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/ars3.jpg" alt=" " title="Interactive Architecture" width="450" height="325" /><br /> </p> <p>The Road Movie is what might be called a mobile installation that originated in conjunction with a live project entitled MobLab in which young Japanese and German artists undertook encounters with art and communication during a journey by bus through Japan. While the group was traveling through a wide variety of landscapes, the webcam mounted on the bus produced five images of the surroundings every five minutes. The image files were uploaded to the Internet in the form of a piece of origami art.</p> <p><a href="http://www.zexe.net/"><strong>canal*ACCESSIBLE</strong></a>  was winner in the <strong>Digital Communities category</strong></p> <p><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/ars4.jpg" alt=" " title="Interactive Architecture" /><br /> <br /> As its name suggests, canal*ACCESSIBLE addresses the accessibility or inaccessibility inherent in the topographical surroundings of people who have difficulty walking. The city of Barcelona is taken as an example. 40 handicapped individuals document the problems they encounter on their waythrough the city by using images and, in a few cases, sound recordings. This material is posted to the website, and the places at which each one was created are specified on a city map. These locations can then be accessed using a built-in find function. The result is a map of Barcelonas inaccessibility for those confined to wheelchairs, a cartographic representation of the parts of town that are closed to people with handicaps. In this way, 3,336 architectural barriers and stumbling blocks have been documented on canal*ACCESSIBLE since December 2005 thus, empowerment of disadvantaged segments of the population as something other than empty phrases for once.</p> <p>The winning project in the u19 freestyle computing competition for young people was <a href="http://www.aarbeitsweg.at.tt/"><strong>Abenteuer Arbeitsweg</strong></a>, an animated film by <strong>Alexander Niederklapfer, David &amp; Magdalena Wurm and Ehrentraud Hager</strong>, Linz youngsters <strong>age 13 to 15.</strong> The project also featured a highly polished website including a trailer and a news service.&nbsp;</p> <p>images are copyright of <a href="http://www.aec.at/en/">ars electonica</a></p>', '2006 Prix Ars Electronica - Winners of the Golden Nicas', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '2006-prix-ars-electronica-winners-of-the-golden-nicas', '', '', '2006-09-05 00:12:42', '2006-09-04 23:12:42', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006-prix-ars-electronica-winners-of-the-golden-nicas.html', 0, 'post', '', 4),

On a personal level it has a reputation for being a closeknit Unit that supports each other rather than everyone working independently from home like some of the other Units. We also likes the odd drink to blow off steam after a hard days work.

Instead he chose to build a new version of the table, this time in the form of an awkward foal, or baby horse table. The foal knows even less about the world than its parent, and spends most of its time blindly moving its legs every which way in a largely futile effort to explore the world. <br />See <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/foal/foal_web.mov">Video</a></p>\n<br /><br />\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><strong>Slowscan Soundwave</strong></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">Slowscan Soundwave is a series of pieces that attempt to create simple physical manifestations of complex physical, biological, and social phenomena. Sound travels through open spaces via the compression and rarefaction (expansion) of air molecules. For example, as the head of a drum vibrates, it pushes and pulls at the air around it. That pushing and pulling creates areas of higher and lower air pressure, which propagate out from the source in waves.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/douglasir2.jpg" />  </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">Slowscan Soundwave 1 uses a microphone to sample the ambient air pressure in its environment. It then uses those samples to change the alignment of seventy nine suspended plastic sheets in an attempt to create a visible analog to those constantly changing pressure fronts. Even the simplest of sounds is too complex, and changes too quickly, to be accurately represented by plastic sheets slowly moving this way and that. As a result the patterns formed by Slowscan Soundwave are a crude approximation of those formed in the air. <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/slowscan_soundwave/SlowscanSoundwave.mov"><br /></a></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/slowscan_soundwave/SlowscanSoundwave.mov"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/douglasir3.jpg" />  </a></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">Slowscan Soundwave 2 much larger version of the work consisting of ten giant suspended strips of transparent mylar. They overlap to form a radial pattern. Each strip is attached, via a string, to one of two small motors. As the sound changes the computer changes the speeds of the motors. One motor''s speed is tied to the volume of the sound in the space: as the volume rises, the speed of the motor increases. The other motor''s speed is tied to the frequencies present in the sound: as the predominant frequency rises, the speed of the motor increases. &ldquo;Since the mylar strips are transparent and were hung about 60 feet above the audience, their effect was very subtle. At times it was difficult to even see them, while at others they would catch a bit of ambient light and then shimmer gently, causing water-like refractions and reflections. The effect was a bit like shouting into a pool of still water: subtle but definite reactions to changes in ambient air pressure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">  </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/douglasir9.jpg" /><br /></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">Slowscan Soundwave 3 was a further iteration made of five 15'' tall columns of transparent mylar strips hanging from the ceiling and two long swoops of mylar cutting a V across the room. continues exploring the idea of making difficult to perceive phenomena a little more perceivable, while attempting to preserve some of the the subtlety and beauty that make the phenomena compelling in the first place. Douglas explains, &ldquo;Here I was thinking a lot about the way sounds travel, and in particular the idea that when a sound happens in one place it has repercussions throughout the space. So when a truck goes by the front window and makes a BANG! as it bounces over a pothole it not only changes the air pressure where human ears are listening, but also causes vibrations in the remote corners of the room. The zigzagging twine connections between motors and mylar, and the placement of the motors as far as possible from the mylar they''re vibrating, are attempts to get at these ideas. <a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/slowscan_soundwave/SlowscanSoundwave.mov">See </a><a href="http://music.columbia.edu/~douglas/portfolio/slowscan_soundwave_iii/slowscan_soundwave_iii_video.mov">Video</a>  </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><strong>puff, bang, reverb</strong></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">There is a grid of small wooden blocks hanging from the ceiling of the space. Each block is attached to the ceiling via a piece of monofilament (fishing line) and hangs about 6&quot; above the floor. In the middle of the grid are two motors, each with a short length of wood attached to its shaft. Hanging in front of the grid at mouth height are two wooden panels. The panels are air-activated switches -- when you blow on them they turn on the motors. When a motor spins it strikes the surrounding blocks of wood. Those blocks in turn strike their neighbors, which then strike their neighbors, and so on. The spinning motor acts like an impulse, injecting energy into the grid of wooden blocks. As the blocks knock into one another that energy slowly spreads throughout the grid.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/douglasir6.jpg" /></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm;">This is roughly analogous to what happens when you blow, clap, or otherwise introduce a sudden burst of energy into the air. Your action displaces air molecules, causing them in turn to displace their neighboring molecules. This action reverberates though the air, transmitting the energy from your action to distant parts of the space. puff bang reverb is a semi-accurate, two-dimensional hyper-zoom into the secret life of displaced air molecules.</p>', 'Douglas Irving Repetto', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'douglas-irving-repetto', '', '', '2006-10-20 00:54:46', '2006-10-19 23:54:46', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/douglas-irving-repetto.html', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The Sensorama was able to display stereoscopic 3D images in a wide-angle view, provide body tilting, supply stereo sound, and also had tracks for wind and aromas to be triggered during the film.

Since the early twentieth century artists have been incorporating movement into art partly to explore the possibilities of movement, partly to introduce the element of time, partly to reflect the importance of the machine and technology in the modern world, partly to explore the nature of vision. Movement has either been produced mechanically by motors or by exploiting the movements of people, air, water, and other kinetic forces in space. A pioneer of Kinetic art was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naum_Gabo">Naum Gabo</a> with his motorised <em>Standing Wave</em> of 1919-20. Mobiles were pioneered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Calder">Alexander Calder</a> from about 1930. Kinetic art became a major phenomenon of the late 1950s and the 1960s. 				<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/kinetic2.jpg" /><br /><br />Marcel Duchamp was the first artist in modern times to use actual movement to explore the mechanics of seeing. The above image is Rotary Glass Plates (Precision Optics), propellerlike pieces of glass painted with black and white lines and mounted on a sturdy metal rotating axle, made in 1920 with the help of his Man Ray. As the motor-driven axle turns, the lines on the separate pieces of glass appear to join up and form complete circles. The Rotary Glass Plates, however, set something of an aesthetic standard. Improvised from an unlikely assortment of materials, motorized, the movement cumbersome and somewhat alarming to watch (one dreads that a glass fragment will detach and become airborne), the overall effect remarkable--this was to become the pattern for many kinetic works over the next five decades.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/kinetic3.jpg" /><br /><br />Above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Moholy-Nagy">Laszlo Moholy-Nagy</a>''s Light-Space Modulator (1922-30), assembled from what looks like a selection of kitchen utensils, is a classic early successor, its collection of metal plates, wires and wooden balls revolving in the beam of two powerful spotlights to create a shadow dance on the adjacent walls.', 'Kinetic Art and Architecture part 1', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'kinetic-art-and-architecture-part-1', '', '', '2006-11-13 00:38:29', '2006-11-12 23:38:29', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/kinetic-art-and-architecture-part-1.html', 0, 'post', '', 4),

Unfortunately I haven''t had a chance up till now to write about it so here''s some of the most exciting aspects of this project developed at MIT. The Zaragoza ''Digital Mile'' will incorporate digital media into everyday aspects of the public realm to make places that respond to their users; accommodate multiple activities; and provide stories, information and services to the people of the city. It will question how can technology enhance public use and enjoyment? Can it make space more productive, or meaningful? What types of urban forms best accommodate digital media? Can it create a public realm that is more flexible and adaptable to different users, activities, or moods? How do you develop content for the media and who should manage it?</p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/digitalmile.jpg" /><br /> </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">All of the spaces, parks and buildings on the Digital Mile include free, public wireless connectivity as well as open access to the digital systems and responsive media elements located along the Mile.  Digital systems are programmable according to users&rsquo; wishes and thus facilitate experiences on the Digital Mile.  </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/digitalmile4.jpg" /> </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">These are concentrated along the pedestrian path called the Paseo del Agua. The WATER WALL is an interactive fountain where people can digitally control the streams of water. With a command &ndash; by jumping into the water or sending a message through an electronic device &ndash; the water can start and stop or change in pressure. This is a monumental urban element like a canal running through</p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/digitalcity3.jpg" /></p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">the city, but twisted into a vertical plane so that people can experience it from a distance as a landmark or interact with it directly. The intelligent streetlight system creates a distinctive atmosphere along the Mile by changing color or intensity in response to the time of day, demands for use, or artistic desires. In tandem, digital street furniture - - like caf&eacute; tables, bus stops, and signage -- display information about such practical matters as menus, bus arrivals, or the location of available parking spaces. These digital systems are intended to make moving through the Digital Mile a seamless, entertaining, and instinctive experience. Two event places, Portillo and Almozara, anchor the Digital Mile and feature responsive digital elements to support different activities and enhance users&rsquo; perceptions of the urban environment.  </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/urbanpixels.jpg" /></p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Affixed to the facades of buildings, <strong>URBAN PIXELS</strong> delineate the edges of the Zaragoza Digital Mile from the rest of the city. When viewed from the air or from the ground by pedestrians, drivers, and train passengers, this &lsquo;light&rsquo; footprint intervention works synchronously or asynchronously to emphasize different moods or zones along the Digital Mile. Each pixel unit includes a solar charging unit and can be programmed wirelessly. </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/memorywalk.jpg" /></p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The <strong>MEMORY WALK</strong> walk makes visible the way people travel through the city by recording pedestrians&rsquo; steps across a space. Every time a footstep falls on a digital paver, the paver emits an additional increment of light. As people cross the pavement, paths of light are illuminated where people tread the most; untread areas emit no light. Thus, people become aware of the traces their movements leave upon the surfaces of the Digital Mile.</p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/digitalawnings.jpg" /></p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>\n<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><strong>DIGITAL AWNINGS</strong> are screens that can rotate in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The movement of the awnings is controlled by either pre-programming, a command by mobile phone, in response to people&rsquo;s physical movements, or in the service of a collective special event. This system enhances the experience of the Digital Mile by displaying abstract, impressionistic, provocative, personalized, or integrative content, including information and images related to Zaragoza&rsquo;s history or people&rsquo;s real-time activities in other areas of the Digital Mile.  </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /> </p>', 'Zaragoza Digital Mile', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'zaragoza-digital-mile', '', '', '2007-01-04 00:29:09', '2007-01-03 23:29:09', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/zaragoza-digital-mile.html', 0, 'post', '', 4),

This project aims to find an elegant            and more effective solution that can realize a controlled flexible environment. Pavel uses            shape memory alloys (SMA) to create moving structures. The assembly represents            an interactive structure with emergent properties. While still at a research stage, I look forward to seeing how it develops, here are more details on the project.</p>\n<br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/pavel3.jpg" />\n<p>The material system consists of components (from spirals of SMA) that            affect each other. The SMA used in the project is a material consisting            of three metals: nickel, titanium, copper (NiTiCu). Because of the characteristic            of the alloy the deformation could be up to 5%. The material features            two structures: the Hot shape and the Cold shape. The cold shape structure            is very soft and could be deformed under load pressure whereas the hot            shape determines the final position of the structure. The final result            is coded to the SMA during the process of its production.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/pavel5.jpg" /></p>\n<p>Components are assembled to create an electrical circuit in addition            with lightweight conductive fibers. NiTiCu spirals serve as resistance            wires. Therefore they are gradually heated. The stability is provided            by lock joints and Teflon foil which serves against buckling of the            whole assembly. Moreover, there is a variant with strong strings that            hold the particles together. Physical representative models tested the            pattern as well as possibilities for assembling the position and size            of components. The proposed system opens a discussion regarding the division of environments            and space. The structure could be used as an &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;            interior division or an environmentally sensitive shelter.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/pavel4.jpg" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.movingstructure.info/">website</a><br /> </p>\n<p>The design of the moving structure takes advantage of the Teflon foils and Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) NiTiCu. This structure is fixed to the ground or to another structure and is a part of the electrical circuit. The reactions controlled by computer are caused by the various circuits which connect the members of spirals of SMAs. The members are covered by the layered Teflon foil which is welded to the shape which is determined by the critical shape of the whole structure.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/pavel6.jpg" /></p>\n<p>The structure changes the shape continuously between the two critical positions. The SMAs change the shape according to the transformation temperature caused by the current passage. The deformation is about 5% but using spirals multiply the result. The transformation temperature is 30&deg;C and that is why the spirals are covered with the heat protection covering. Two conditions of the structure come out from the characteristics of NiTiCu - the cold shape and the hot shape. The structure could be packed and transported during the cold shape position. The spirals of SMAs are welded to the joints which are connected by the system of locks which provides the stiffness of the whole structure. The structure is multilevel, and allotted chains determine the critical shape.<br /> </p>', 'Moving Structure - Pavel Hladik', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'moving-structure-pavel-hladik', '', '', '2007-01-09 00:14:47', '2007-01-08 23:14:47', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/moving-structure-pavel-hladik.html', 0, 'post', '', 5),

Postgraduate Architecture students take a 2 year Diploma where the second year of the course is set up to encourage directed research&nbsp; into a particular aspect of design. Our students chose to investigate the architecture of time-based transformation.&nbsp; Projects vary from speculations about large long-term landscape transformations to the construction of&nbsp; 1:1&nbsp; responsive and interactive installations.  <br /><br />Graduates from the studio include <a href="http://www.jasonbruges.com/">Jason Bruges</a> , <a href="http://www.haque.co.uk/">Usman Haque</a> , <a href="http://www.philayres.org">Phil Ayres</a> , <a href="http://www.chrisleung.org/">Chris Leung</a> , <a href="http://www.unnameable.org/">James O''Leary</a>.<br /><br /><em>top image, Toby Carr, bottom image Collage of Unit 14 projects</em></p>', 'Interactive Architecture - Eyebeam - New York', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'interactive-architecture-eyebeam-new-york', '', '', '2007-01-21 19:26:08', '2007-01-21 18:26:08', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/interactive-architecture-eyebeam-new-york.html', 0, 'post', '', 3),

Gary founded his company EDGE in 1994, and quickly gained a reputation for his dedication to work and award-winning multi-disciplinary designs.

Ultimate spatial flexibility is created through the multiple operations of the partitions. lighting. and mobile furniture. All the mundane necessities of bachelor life - books. CDs. clothing, pictures. stereo, videos are stacked on a chrome factory shelving system and hidden discreetly behind floating white curtains. the central space becomes the actual space for living, working, eating, sleeping, chatting, dressing and reading. Blue fluorescent tubes are carefully placed to wash the floor with an unearthly glow, while bright up-lighting articulates structural members. the main aperture of the front window offers views to the world beyond whether the actual view out of the window, or through the large scale movie screen to the fantasy world of hollywood, the real world of news, or the electronic world of internet.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2006/edge6.jpg" /></p>\n<p>The progression from this project was the<strong> ''Suitcase House Hotel''</strong> which the images above and below show<br /> </p>\n<p>&quot;Casting a question mark on the proverbial image of the house, Suitcase House Hotel attempts to rethink the nature of intimacy, privacy, spontaneity and flexibility.

In the evening, when more guests arrive, the entire space turns into a lounge for party, celebration and other events. Rooms could then be gradually formulated when the night falls. A maximum of 7 guest rooms would be formed, which may accommodate up to 14 guests if the party goes late and they stay overnight.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src="/assets/2006/edge4.jpg" alt="" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To blur the boundaries between House, Interior and Furniture, the entire structure and elements are monotonically cladded in timber inside and outside of the steel structure supported by and cantilevered out from the concrete base which house facilities including a pantry, maid''s quarter, boiler room and the sauna.</p>\n<p><img src="/assets/2006/edge5.jpg" alt="" /></p>\n<p><br /> &nbsp;</p>', 'Gary Chang - Reconfigurable Living Spaces - Suitcase House Hotel', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'gary-chang-reconfigurable-living-spaces-suitcase-house-hotel', '', '', '2007-02-19 00:10:57', '2007-02-18 23:10:57', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/gary-chang-reconfigurable-living-spaces-suitcase-house-hotel.html', 0, 'post', '', 8),

The panels are grafted into an existing environment, supported by structural racks allowing a range of different configurations. The SplineGraft can be set in different overall shapes independent of its behavior. The different parts are grafted onto each other; the profiled polyurethane panels are articulated by the configuration of the structural racks. The texture of this primary form is reshaped in real time by the control system integrated in the structural racks; a continuous form finding process with emergent patterning effects. In return, the spline ridges of the panels disperse these transformations horizontally.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/krets2.jpg" /><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Structure</strong><br /><br />The supporting structural racks are assembled from cnc-milled clear acrylic units, each integrating the actuating mechanisms, milled tracks for cabling and etched nickel brass conduits for inter-unit connectivity. The angle between each structural component can be set in five different positions, allowing the rack to be set at a convex or concave configuration, while maintaining conductive links between each part. Each rack of five units is controlled by a micro controller, steering the integrated actuators in the form of dual shape memory alloy wires. The central intelligence of each rack communicates with neighboring racks through radio.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/krets4.jpg" /><br /><br /><strong>SplineGraft behavior</strong><br /><br />The behaviour of the SplineGraft is controlled by a genetic algorithm; a computer program that simulates and compresses the geologically slow processes of natural selection to nanoseconds of computational time, in order to evolve solutions to specific problems. The Spline Graft algorithm is in this way trying to emit patterns of movement which stimulate occupation of the space it has been grafted in to. The matching of sensor readings and motor reactions in an apparently intentional way by the Spline Graft, transforms architecture into a cybernetic agent involved in the making and production of space.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/krets3.jpg" /><br /><br /><strong>SplineGraft materials</strong><br /><br />CNC-milled acrylic structural components with integrated wiring, machined polyurethane foam, etched nickel brass conductors, IR Movement Sensor, custom made PCB Cards, AVR Atmega8 Microcontrollers, Radio Modules, diverse electronic components, Flexinol&reg; shape memory alloy actuators with protective Teflon tubes. <a href="http://www.krets.org/index.php">SplineGraft</a> was developed by Krets partners <a href="http://www.armyofclerks.net/">Pablo Miranda</a> and <a href="http://www.runberger.net/">Jonas Runberger</a>.

How can we build environments that are interactive as apposed to reactive? What does an interactive architecture offer us over a reactive architecture? What does interactive architecture offer us over the lifetime of the buildings and wider landscape we inhabit? These questions go back much further than this particular project, and in fact,&nbsp; were the reason I started this blog in the first place. <br /></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img src="/assets/portfolio/performative/extraimage2.jpg" alt="" /> </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">If I was to try and sum it up in a sentence, it is fundamentally about giving our architecture the ability to enter into dialog with us, rather than simply respond with fixed behaviours to fixed commands from us, to learm from its experiences and adapt its behaviours, to suggest new spatial configurations and see how we respond. Very often I find that so called ''interactive environments'' rarely enable the architecture to negotiate its behaviours , but rather follow pre-choreographed routines when triggered. More broadly, a great deal of misuse of the term ''interactive'' is common in art, design and architectural discourse and I believe that this has diluted its true meaning and huge potential. My <a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/portfolio/performativeecologies.html">description of &ldquo;Performative Ecologies&rdquo;</a> should reveal some of the ideas I''ve developed, and present where I think the most interesting possibilities exist.

Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays integrated with the fabric of built structures allow prominent imagery to be integrated with the fa&ccedil;ade, even in direct sunlight. Although energy requirements are practical only when displays are used in less bright conditions, there remain significant consequences for the townscape and urban environment; cinematic topias as pervasive as Minority Report and Blade Runner have become technically feasible.</p>\n<p class="t1">The MediaArchitecture2007 conference creates a new discourse among the latest theoretical and practical approaches. By reviewing outstanding projects and presenting the views of key architectural theorists, media activists, planners, advertisers and artists, the conference will provide the first-depth consideration of the intersection of media and architecture - the premise that architecture and media issues will increasingly be considered together, at the conceptual stages of building planning. Image has become an architectural element; media increasingly pervade the built environment introducing an important ontological element.</p>\n<img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/mediaarchitecture2.jpg" /><br /><font size="1"><a href="http://www.blipcreative.com/products.html">blip</a> LED Display</font><br />\n<p class="t1">Altering the architectural relationship between image and structure has several significant implications &ndash; not only for visual encounter with the completed building, but in terms of planning and construction processes. The emergence of intelligent construction materials, which themselves incorporate display and data components, departs markedly from existing fa&ccedil;ade implementations in which lighting and display products have been applied in building projects where the underlying architecture is already advanced. The media fa&ccedil;ade becomes a data system to be specified and commissioned with the expectation of lifetime and maintenance commensurate with other structural elements. Content &ndash; the data and imagery that it will carry during that lifetime - is very different from both the rectangular clip material now common on LED billboards and from programmed lighting effects.<br /><br /><strong>        MediaArchitecture2007 will address these inversions in several respects:</strong></p>\n<p class="t1">&ndash; the impact on architectural theory of practical media fa&ccedil;ade systems<br /> &ndash; departure of imagery from the confines of the clip towards dynamic creative based on building management and external information<br />   &ndash; the practical challenges of large scale displays for urban planning; display viewing design in public spaces<br /> &ndash; sustainable display and image data systems that can be specified directly by architects and installed by the construction industry and which are maintainable over the lifetime of a media fa&ccedil;ade</p>\n<p class="t1"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/mediaarchitecture4.jpg" /><br /><font size="1"><a href="http://www.mediaarchitecture.org/conf/about/aspire-tower-qatar/">Aspire Tower</a>, Qatar</font> </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">SPEAKERS &amp; CURATORS INCLUDE:<br /><br />Bart Lootsma, Ludger Hovestadt, Realities United, Andrew Shoben, Kari Jormakka, Joachim Sauter, David Cunningham, Mark Dorrian, Michael Batz, Hermann Eisenk&ouml;ck, Patricia Austin, Tim Pritlove, Rogier van der Heide, Malcom McCullough, Mark Dorrian, Els Vermang.

Now some practitioners have disengaged from tectonics as we traditionally understand it and are taking their discipline into the realms of &lsquo;softspace&rsquo;, a more fluid, ephemeral form of digitally-enabled design based on personalised experiences and responses. Softspace deploys new spatial systems including wearable computing, wifi, RFID and custom-designed digital software incorporating light, heat, sound and electromagnetic fields. These not only rely on people&rsquo;s individual ways of interacting with them, but are enriched by narratives people contribute, creating new metaphors of use. Responsive environmental strategies of this kind have increasingly colonised museums and galleries like Tate, the Science Museum and the V&amp;A While the notion of a fantasy world made possible &lsquo;on demand&rsquo; by new technologies is the theme of films like Minority Report and ExistenZ, contemporary softspace projects play a more subtle and open-ended influence on contemporary socio-spatial dynamics and our sensing abilities.&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/tatesoft.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">left Daan Roosegaarde&nbsp; - <a href="http://www.studioroosegaarde.net/work_html.php?id=24">Dune</a> , right Jason Bruges Studio - <a href="http://www.jasonbruges.com/">Wind to Light</a></font><br /><br /><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/eventseducation/talksdiscussions/9811.htm"></a>', 'Softspace - Contemporary Interactive Environments', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'softspace-contemporary-interactive-environments', '', '', '2007-09-03 15:51:57', '2007-09-03 14:51:57', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/softspace-contemporary-interactive-environments.html', 0, 'post', '', 1),

During the day, the &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; of green ambiguous forms, both biomorphic and geometric,  accentuates the South Campus&rsquo;s main entry. At twilight, the swarm comes to life, telling visitors and passersby about the current air quality around the building.   Electronic sensors perceive air contaminants &ndash; such as tobacco, benzene, carbon  monoxide, even perfume &ndash; and separately inform the outside and inside swarms, which  sets off signals.  These signals are interpreted as changes to the natural rhythm  that the network has established based on the number and distribution of nodes  connected to the cable net. Flashing cells on the exterior fa&Aacute;ade indicate air  quality inside the building. Conversely, pulsating effects in the interior  entry inform visitors about the outside air quality. The flashing lights become  indicators of the environment like dramatic clouds at sunset that forewarnings  of storms at night.</p>\n<img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/houseswarm2.jpg" />\n<p> HouseSwarming is an example of how architects and designers are using technology  that mimics biological systems.

Meanwhile, on Sunday I managed to catch up with <a href="http://www.studioroosegaarde.net">Daan Roosegaarde</a> for a few drinks and talk about his most recent interactive installations including Flow 5.0 (pictured above). Daan describes Flow as&nbsp; &quot;An interactive sculpture made out of hundreds of ventilators which are reacting to your sound and motion. By walking and interacting an illusive landscape of transparancies and ''artificial wind'' is created. Moving through Flow 5.0 the visitor becomes conscious of himself as a body, in a dynamic relation with space and technology. Currently Flow 5.0 is further developed as a large architectural intervention <a href="http://www.todaysart.nl/2007/artists.php">commissioned by TodaysArt.</a>&rdquo;</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/flow2.jpg" /> </p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">What I find interesting about Daan''s approach is that his installations are not simply built and shipped off to various exibitions so that everyone sees the same work. Instead, he is continually developing his existing installations adapting the software and materials to new contexts, and strategies of interaction. He''s also open about how his work is very much a team effort with the support of programmers, engineers and production assistants who are all given the freedom to push their interests within the work which he conceives of, and creatively directs. I look forward to seeing what Flow 6.0 looks like soon.</p>', 'Flow 5.0 - Daan Roosegaarde', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'flow-50-daan-roosegaarde', '', '', '2007-09-14 15:40:51', '2007-09-14 14:40:51', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/flow-50-daan-roosegaarde.html', 0, 'post', '', 0),

This two-day workshop, on the theme of &ldquo;Metabolic Network&rdquo;, brings together five researchers working in the area of electronic sensing in art and design, with a special focus on textiles and architectural-scale applications. The network will be a large installation made from a field of suspended fibers that have different properties: such as elasticity, conductivity, dissolvability, or luminosity. By joining the fibers together, a field of possibilities open up and patterns within the field emerge.

As the opening panel it revealed the current technological developents in media-facade design and exposed the practical experiences of the speakers over a range of different approaches, programs and contexts. As the opening panel, it set the stage for discussing &quot;the next step&quot; and revealed the speed at which technological development is occuring. <br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma2.jpg" /><br /><br />Of course architectural design is in no small part, driven by the technologies available to it, and with the refinement of LED components originally used in LED advertising billboards we are seeing a growth in there use in the design of the built enviornment. At the same time the development of sustainable computing and network systems able to operate extensive fa&ccedil;ade data systems over long periods of time, has led to robust and economical systems that satisfy the requirements demanded by architects and building owners.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma1.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Ludger </font><span class="name"><font size="1">Hovestadt speaking</font><br /><br /></span><strong>Architecture and Flusser&rsquo;s Technical Images - Prof. Ludger Hovestadt</strong><br /><br /><span class="t1"> Ludger Hovestadt began the day with an entertaining talk which started with him describing how </span>against the background of the information technologies, architecture has gained a new reality. <span class="t1">A reality becoming ''creamier and creamier'', a phrase that caught on, and was used by a number of later speakers. As a professor for architecture and CAAD at ETHZ where his </span><span class="t1">interdisciplinary </span><span class="t1">research involves architecture, computer science, mechanical engineering, robotics and cognitive psychology, he spoke about his current research which centres on the adaptation of technological developments made in other industries of expertise, into the building industry. <br /><br /></span><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma3.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Example of Nano materials providing base materials for new technologies - The University of Toronto has developed a ''spray on'' solar collection material that is capable of capturing energy in the infra red spectrum</font><br /><span class="t1"><br />Looking through the technological development of the &quot;information society&quot;, he described how the granularity of objects is becoming smaller and smaller, until today matter can be investigated and described </span>at sub-atomic scale. &quot;The Big Zoom&quot; as he called it, gives us an undertanding of the materials available to us which has led us to reconstructing objects from their most fundamental parts. We can build our environment from atomic scales upwards developing new smart, responsive and communicative material constructs. &quot;No longer are objects or processes the constituting elements of a building. Now they are described as technical networks of communicating nodes, which balance themselves in contrived patterns.&quot;<br /><br /><img src="/assets/2007/ma4.jpg" alt="" /><br /><strong></strong><font size="1">&quot;Printable&quot;&nbsp;solar cells are&nbsp;coated with a common ingredient used in toothpaste and suntan lotion and are able to produce electricity from direct sunlight as well as low-light and indoor lighting. They are manufactured with a process similar to inject printing.</font><br /><br />These ideas of creating new materials from elemental levels has a longer history in science, but with the aid of digital computation we are seeing a wide range of rapid protoyping and CAD-CAM systems giving architects the ability to construct bespoke materials in relation to specific needs at low costs, quickly. One example of this change in design and manufacture of our built environment highlighted by Ludger, are <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/04/13/solarcells_tec.html?category=technology&amp;guid=20070413090000">printable solar cells</a>. With current solar technology becoming financially benefical, and with print on demand, Ludger suggested that perhaps one day we could print onto virtually any other material, mixing previously unlike material combinations, to generate sustainable power supplies in the most unlikely of scenarios. <br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma5.jpg" /><br /><font size="1"><a href="http://reprap.org/bin/view/Main/WebHome">RepRap&nbsp;</a> - Replicating Rapid-prototyper.

The windowless Galleria West mall used to be a drab, understated presence in the Apgujeong-dong district, one of Seoul''s most exclusive shopping areas. The client, Hanwha Stores Co, wanted to turn it into a landmark building that would reflect the exclusive boutiques within its walls.<br /><br /><img alt="notredame" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma7.jpg" />\n<p> </p>\n<p>UN Studio and Arup Lighting were brought on board to recreate the mall''s exterior, with additional support from Arup''s structural engineers. Together they developed a chameleon-like facade that reflects the subtleties of natural light on opalescent, dichroic glass discs during the day. At night the discs are individually backlit and controlled by a computer program to create colour schemes all over the building - each disc acting like a big pixel on a screen.</p>\n<img alt="notredame" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma8.jpg" />\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Rogier van der Heide went through various stages of modelling the facade, begining with very simply with cardboard, fibre optics, gels, and colour filters, followed by more sophisticated technologies and analysis, plus input from fellow design team members. 4330 discs, each 850mm in diameter, make up the entire facade of the mall.</p>\n<br /><strong>Dr. Gernot Tscherteu, mediafacade.net - a team approach to develop standardised media facade components.</strong><br /><br />Gernot explained that <a href="http://www.mediafacade.net">mediafacade.net</a> was a research group, comprising of design consultancies and major architectural and manufacturing companies as well as research institutions. &quot;The group&rsquo;s main innovations arise from its simultaneous reformulation of all of the architectural, structural and electronic components required for next-generation media facades so that display and built structure merge functionally, technically and aesthetically.&quot; He began by making some observations that often the relationship between the building and contemporary media facades is quite seperate and that the challenge is to build closer connections between the building and its facade, &quot;between the form of the building and its skin&quot;. His criticisms of much screen technology in urban settings, was that it covered up buildings, rather than intergrating into a more unified architecture.&nbsp; Using examples of the media facades that cover Times Square in New York he argued that co-operation between architects, and engineers should begin with the design of the lighting components themselves rather than architects using lighting technology &quot;off the shelf&quot;. <br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma9.jpg" /><br /><br />&quot;While there are now many examples of ambitious projects, significant issues of resolution, brightness, maintenance expenditure and invasiveness of display systems with the building spaces located behind them, still remain. In this last respect, especially, difficulties arise because most media facades are planned after the architectural concepts &ndash; and often much of the construction itself &ndash; have been completed. In contrast, mediafacade.net considers display systems to be an integral part of architecture and the construction of such display systems to require long-life building components and materials in the same way as glazing and HVAC installations.&quot;<br /><br /><img width="450" height="265" alt="" src="http://www.mediafacade.net/extern/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/An3neu.gif" /><br /><br />One part I found paricularily interesting was in all the challenges faced in such development work. Gernot disected the issues faced when designing these schemes into 4 main parts. Im afraid that I didnt quite have time to complete my notes so apologies to Gernot but heres what I got.<br /><br /><strong>Content/Format</strong> - viewing distances - resolution - narrative/symbolic - day/night<br /><strong>Display Tech</strong> - maintainance - cabling - energy - sun protection - structure<br /><strong>Urban Plan</strong> - traffic - light polution - neighbours - cultural heritage<br /><strong>Building</strong> - Users <br /><br />After discussing some of these he ended his talk by presenting some current research on the development of aluminuium extrusions for combining structural strength and screen technologies into the buildings core framework. More information about their development of standardised media facade components can be found at <a href="http://www.mediafacade.net/extern/home">www.mediafacade.net<br /></a><br /><br /><strong>Thomas Schwed - Mediafacades as integral part of architecture</strong><br /><br />The final speaker in the panel was Thomas Schwed who presented a series of projects he was involved in alongside examples of other artists, architects and designers operating at around the same which I thought was a very nice approach to looking at specific issues in his own work as well as more global issues in the design of mediafacdes. In particluar he spoke about his experiences developing a media skin for the <img alt="" src="file:///C:/DOCUME~1/RUAIRI~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg" />T-Center (Vienna), an office building completed in 2004 and designed by architect G&uuml;nther Domenig. In the end, due to urban planning restricting the facade to non-commercial imagery, the client of the architects eventually dropped the proposal due to financial issues. <br /><br /><img src="/assets/2007/ma11.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />Thomas'' discussion highlighted a re-occuring theme in how clients consider these technologies and the financial attraction of these kinds of systems weighed up against the aesthetic implications for content on such media facades. I personally liked the T-Center as it is, without a mediafacade but its often difficult to really assess looking at renders and animation how successful these kinds of proposal will be until the lights are turned on for real. Certainly there are examples where mediafacades have been benefical to architectural projects but in this case, we shall never know. <br /><br /><img src="/assets/2007/ma12.jpg" alt="" />', 'MediaArchitecture - New Technologies and New Materials', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mediaarchitecture-new-technologies-and-new-materials', '', '', '2007-09-25 00:50:31', '2007-09-24 23:50:31', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/mediaarchitecture-new-technologies-and-new-materials.html', 0, 'post', '', 3),

Mirjam began by highlighting the new challenges faced in urban design and planning  caused by the use of media technologies, in particular, LED screens. The main focus was how these technologies have a social impact and how how cities have responded to these entering our public spaces. Along side the discussion on urbanism, individual projects were discussed by some of the panelists who are working in the field of interactive design and architecture.<br /><br /><img src="/assets/2007/ma15.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.interactionfield.de/">Mirjam Struppek</a> has been very active over the past couple of years organizing events such as <font color="#000000"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbanscreens.org/">Urban      Screens</a> 05 held in Amsterdam</font>, and building up a <a href="http://www.urbanscreens.org/">great online resource</a> for people interested in how the currently commercial use of outdoor screens can be broadened with cultural content.&nbsp; &quot;We want to network and sensitise all engaged parties for the possibilities of using the digital infrastructure for contributing to a lively urban society, binding the screens more to the communal context of the space and therefore creating local identity and engagement. The integration of the current information technologies support the development of a new integrated digital layer of the city in a complex merge of material and immaterial space that redefine the function of this growing infrastructure.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>Malcom McCullough</strong><br /><br />Following Mirjam''s introduction <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mmmc/">Malcom McCullough</a> spoke about how this new medium added another layer of information to the city and how information could be considered in itself a kind of pollution. He described how the ratio of information to knowledge is declining and the responses some cities have had to mediafacades that contain commercial content.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma13.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Sau Paulo following the ban on urban advertising</font><br /><br /><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/14/sao-paulo-goes-adver.html">Malcom used the example of Sau Paulo </a>where on January 1st, 2007, the city of approximately eleven million people, South America&rsquo;s largest, awoke to find a ban on public advertising. Every billboard, every neon sign, every bus kiosk ad and even the Goodyear blimp were suddenly illegal.&nbsp; The ban on what the mayor calls &ldquo;visual pollution&rdquo; was the culmination of a long battle between the city&rsquo;s politicians and the advertising industry, which had blanketed Brazil&rsquo;s economic capital with all manner of billboards, both legal and illegal. Within months, the city has gone from a Blade Runner-like vision of the future to a reclaimed past. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tonydemarco/sets/72157600075508212/">More Images</a>  <br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma14.jpg" /><br /><br /><strong>Prof. Joachim Sauter</strong> - <strong>ART+COM</strong> - <strong>New Media in Public Space</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://www.artcom.de/?lang=en">ART+COM</a> are a well known and highly regarded German interaction design studio who have done a number of public interactive installations. <a href="http://www.artcom.de/index.php?option=com_acteammember&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=121&amp;lang=en">Joachim</a> as a director spoke about their practice and their approach to using media technologies to create dynamic spatial experiences.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma20.jpg" /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma19.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Renders of one of the projects Joachim Sauter discussed called Duality</font><br /><br />&quot;During the last years, &ldquo;New&rdquo; Media have advanced more and more from private and semi-public institutional spaces into public city space. The reasons for this are two fold. The necessary technologies have become cheaper, more easily manageable and more stable; users of city space are media literate, and the designers and decision makers are better educated and skilled.&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma17.jpg" /><br /><br /> In the design of media fa&ccedil;ades, ART+COM are directed by two principles stemming from &ldquo;fa&ccedil;ade&rsquo;s&rdquo; etymological root &lsquo;facies&rdquo;, Latin for &lsquo;face&rsquo;. They design&nbsp; &quot;the skin of a face, not a mask or make-up. This means that the media have to be an integral part of the architecture, not something added as an obvious later thought. The second principle is the face&rsquo;s mimics and its expression. The narrative on the fa&ccedil;ade is thus expressive of the building, its architectural stance and its interior. The fa&ccedil;ade is a membrane from inside to outside and from outside to inside.&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma18.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">&quot;Duality&quot; completed</font><br /><br />Joachim went through a number of projects which I can''t cover all of here. One project in particular which caught my eye was &quot;<a href="http://www.artcom.de/index.php?option=com_acprojects&amp;page=6&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=113&amp;details=0&amp;lang=en">Duality</a>&quot;. Located on the bank of an artificial pond at the exit of the metro station Osaki. The project deals with the &quot;duality between liquid / solid, real / virtual and water ripples / light waves. Pedestrians walk over a 6 x 6 meters large LED plane, installed right on the edge of the water. The LEDs are covered with translucent glass diffusing their light. With their steps, the passers-by provoke virtual waves on the LED plane, computed in real-time. When these waves hit the edge of the pond, they are extended into the water as real ripples. It looks really magical and brought a childish smile to my face with its combination of screen and kinetic technology.<br /><br />see more of ART+COM''s <a href="http://www.artcom.de/index.php?option=com_acprojects&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=115&amp;lang=en">projects here</a><br /><br /><strong>Andrew Shoben - </strong><span class="pink"><strong>Greyworld - Transforming the City into an Urban Playground<br /><br /></strong></span><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma21.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Greyworlds &quot;The Source&quot;</font><br /><span class="pink"><br /></span><span class="t3">Andrew spoke about ways of transforming the urban realm into a public playground. To allow some form of self-expression, through small interventions in the urban surround, in areas of the city that people see everyday but normally exclude and ignore. Using <a href="http://www.greyworld.org/#news_/v1">Greyworld</a>s own projects such as <a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/grey-world.html">The Source</a> (2004) their 32m kinetic sculpture which opens the London market every morning at the London Stock Exchange as well as their much lower tech railings project , he presented how <strong>Play</strong> can be an intergral part of the experience of our whole built environment.<br /><br /></span><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma22.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Greyworld Railings project<br /><br /></font><span class="t3">Andrew talked about how he wanted people to find emotional connections with their work and give little twists to the urban experience&quot;Art for people on the way to the supermarket&quot; as he put it. Greyworlds &quot;Railings&quot; project was a perfect example of this, </span>working with the childish pleasure of running a stick along a set of railings to make a &quot;clack-clack-clack&quot; sound. Instead of a\n clack clack sound they tuned the railings so that when you ran a stick along them they it played &quot;the Girl from Ipanema.&quot;<br /><span class="t3"><br /><strong>Michael Batz - Hamburg Art Ensemble: Scenographies of a City</strong><br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.michaelbatz.de/">Michael</a> spoke of how Contemporary Lighting Master Plans define the underlying conditions for lighting public spaces: intelligent harmonization of all light sources on the urban stage in order to give the greatest flexibility while at the same time consuming as little energy as possible. &quot;A new perception-oriented approach to lighting planning for architecture and urban areas is now becoming significant, in contrast to earlier technical-functional methods. Accentuated by the paradigm shift towards the &ldquo;reflecting city&rdquo; from the traditional stone and translucent (glass) cities, responsibilities for transforming the townscape and the city identity have now received political meaning.&quot;<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/ma23.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">panel - Mirjam Struppek, Malcom McCullough, Michael Batz, Andrew Shoben and Joachim Sauter</font><br /><br />He also explained that any attempt to do          justice to a locality must inevitably take into account the existing specific          architecture. Basically, it is not a matter of ''throwing'' light at a group          of structures, but using light to accentuate them as a special treasure          of the city. In other documentation of Michael I found this quote particularly interesting &quot;Rhythmisation, characterisation, accentuation - concepts traditionally          used in the theatre - are appropriate here. Atmosphere, emotion and changes          in ways of viewing are qualities that have a major influence on the character          of a city. Artistic concepts can be compositionally fruitful here: playing          with tones and hierarchies of brightness, temporary strong chords over          restful bass lines, the rejection of over-accentuation, deliberate omissions          and the retention of the essence of darkness.&quot;<span class="t3"> A general discussion at the end focused on the problems each of the presenters had with the idea of the architecture being overwhelmed by screen technology. One mentioned that the architecture of the cityscape is scenographic enough and questioned if there was any need to embed stories when architecture can do that itself? I couldn''t agree more with this statement and </span>I''m glad that the entire conference was focused on the really important question, how media technologies can go beyond &quot;urban screens&quot;, beyond hi-tech billboard s for advertising and engage us in new types of scenographic and emotive experience. It was evident in the work of ART+COM and Greyworld that there is clearly a lot of potential, for spatial and time-based narration that could go beyond linear and undemocratic screens. The next morning I was lucky enough to be starting the 2nd day of talks with this issue in mind, and presented how I thought contemporary architecture and urban design could learn a lot from some of the mediaarchitecture of the 1950''s and 60''s...  more on that soon.  <span class="t3"></span>', 'MediaArchitecture - Media Urbanism', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'mediaarchitecture-media-urbanism', '', '', '2007-09-27 00:02:41', '2007-09-26 23:02:41', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/mediaarchitecture-media-urbanism.html', 0, 'post', '', 1),

And what will technology enable us or indeed disable us from achieving. Futuristic visions from science fiction cinema borrow much from the leading technology of their time, to imagine our future homes, workplaces and cities. I''ve always had a laugh watching the 1940''s-50''s films which show a house wife getting her personal tin foil wrapped robot to do the dishes while she can get on with other important jobs like getting her makeup on to greet her husband when he comes in from a hard day at the office. <br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/earch8.jpg" /><br />\n<div align="center"><font size="1">Leave It to Roll-Oh (1940)</font></div>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Well its hardly suprising that film makers had less glossy visions of the future and I''ve been making a special effort recently to watch films that have explored the kinds of future architecture and cities we may one day inhabit.

One idea in particular which captured the imagination of many writers and directors was that of artificial intelligence and the kinds of power struggles that could ensue between humanity and intelligent agents. With the development of my own work in adaptive systems recently, I have spent a considerable amount of my work invested in understanding the current state of artificial intelligence research. I''m pleased to see that the dystopian visions of man vs machine are for the time being at least, some way off, since we can''t get much more than insect level intelligence out of computational systems. <br /></p>\n<br />\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/earch.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Metropolis (1927)</font></p>\n<font size="1"></font>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">None the less, progress is being made and it was while visiting MIT last week that I got an opportunity to listen to Marvin Minsky speak a little, about his involvement in the development of AI since the 1960''s.&nbsp; He currently believes &quot;we need to find more complicated ways to explain our most familiar mental events&quot;; we need to break our thought processes down into the most precise steps possible. In fact, in order to truly understand the human mind, Minsky suggests, we''ll probably need to reverse-engineer a machine that can replicate those functions so we can study it. Thus, he rejects the idea of consciousness as a unitary &quot;Self&quot; in favor of &quot;a decentralized cloud&quot; of more than 20 distinct mental processes. In this view, emotional states like love and shame are not the opposite of rational cogitation; both, Minsky says, are ways of thinking. <br /><br />A FREE draft Copy of his recent book <strong>The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind </strong>is available from his website (find links below)<br /><br /><strong>The Emotion Machine : Marvin Minsky</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Eminsky/Introduction.html">Introduction</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Eminsky/E1/eb1.html">Chapter 1.

Here is an excerpt from a recent interview.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back when I was writing The Society of Mind, we worked for a couple of years on making a computer understand a simple children''s story: &quot;Mary was invited to Jack''s party. She wondered if he would like a kite.&quot; If you ask the question &quot;Why did Mary wonder about a kite?&quot; everybody knows the answer -- it''s probably a birthday party, and if she''s going that means she has been invited, and everybody who is invited has to bring a present, and it has to be a present for a young boy, so it has to be something boys like, and boys like certain kinds of toys like bats and balls and kites. You have to know all of that to answer the question. We managed to make a little database and got the program to understand some simple questions. But we tried it on another story and it didn''t know what to do. Some of us concluded that you''d have to know a couple million things before you could make a machine do some common-sense thinking.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/earch4.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">I Robot (2004)</font><br /></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">He goes onto explain that emotions enable us to swap between different modes of thinking depending on the situation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main idea in the book is what I call resourcefulness. Unless you understand something in several different ways, you are likely to get stuck. So the first thing in the book is that you have got to have different ways of describing things. I made up a word for it: &quot;panalogy.&quot; When you represent something, you should represent it in several different ways, so that you can switch from one to another without thinking.</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/earch5.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Silent Running (1972)</font><br /></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing is that you should have several ways to think. The trouble with AI is that each person says they''re going to make a system based on statistical inference or genetic algorithms, or whatever, and each system is good for some problems but not for most others. The reason for the title The Emotion Machine is that we have these things called emotions, and people think of them as mysterious additions to rational thinking. My view is that an emotional state is a different way of thinking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you''re angry, you give up your long-range planning and you think more quickly. You are changing the set of resources you activate. A machine is going to need a hundred ways to think. And we happen to have a hundred names for emotions, but not for ways to think. So the book discusses about 20 different directions people can go in their thinking. But they need to have extra meta-knowledge about which way of thinking is appropriate in each situation. <br /><br />Minsky also expresses disappointment about &quot;how few people have been working on higher-level theories of how thinking works&quot;, that too many &quot;people look around to see what field is currently popular, and then waste their lives on that. If it''s popular, then to my mind you don''t want to work on it.&quot;</p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img alt="" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2007/earch6.jpg" /><br /><font size="1">Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)</font></p>\n<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I''m personally more a fan of Rodney Brooks who claims that Minsky erred in not putting the concepts of situatedness and embodiment onto the AI research agenda and from the work I''ve personally done with building simple robotic systems, Brooks approach is more applicable to the kinds of systems I create but Minsky''s ideas do raise the question, will we need to spoon feed our architecture common sense? There is no clear cut answer for all circumstances but personally I find bottom up strategies of situatedness and embodiment more appealing from an architectural perspective.<br /><br /> </p>', 'Emotional Architecture?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'emotional-architecture', '', '', '2007-10-18 13:47:33', '2007-10-18 12:47:33', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/emotional-architecture.html', 0, 'post', '', 4),

When completely in sync, the work appears almost solid then suddenly almost invisible. When far out of sync, the sculptural elements float in apparent chaos.

The living city - a platform for the future when buildings talk to one another\n\n"<img src="/assets/2008/living.jpg" alt="The Living" />\n\n"In the future, buildings will talk to one another. In the era of ubiquitous computing—as sensors disappear into the woodwork and all kinds of data is transferred instantly and wirelessly—buildings will communicate information about their local conditions to a network of other buildings. Architecture will come to life. Living City is an ecology of facades where individual buildings collect data, share it with others in their social network, and respond to the collective body of knowledge."\n\n2. An exploration of the vitality of the city through new forms of public space—air and facade\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/living6.jpg" alt="The Living" />\n\n"In the future, public space in the city will be everywhere. Air will be public space. Building facades will be public space. Both will belong equally to everyone in the city, no less valuable than the traditional fixed public space of parks and streets. At the intersection of air and facade, public space will be distributed and dynamic. Architecture will come to life. Living City is a definition of air as public space and building facades as public space."\n\n3. A prototype facade that breathes in response to air quality\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/living2.jpg" alt="The Living" />\n\nIn the future, walls will breathe. Construction materials and systems that have been inert for thousands of years will respond in real time to the dynamic conditions of their surroundings and to a larger network of data. Buildings will host public interfaces to air quality and make visible the invisible conditions of the environment. Architecture will come to life. Living City is a full-scale building skin designed to open and close its gills in response to air quality."\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/living5.jpg" alt="The Living" />', 'Living City', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'living-city', '', '', '2008-01-14 00:02:05', '2008-01-13 23:02:05', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/living-city.html', 0, 'post', '', 5),

His ground-breaking sculptures explored the interaction between his robotic works and the audience, and reached their height with The Senster, a large (15 feet long), hydraulic robot commissioned by the electronics giant, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Philips</a>, in Eindhoven in 1970. The sculpture used sound and movement sensors to react to the behaviour of the visitors. It was one of the first computer controlled interactive robotic works of art.\n\n<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1jDt5unArNk&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1jDt5unArNk&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>\n\n<a href="http://www.senster.com/alex_zivanovic/index.htm">Alex Zivanovic</a>, a Visiting Scholar at the <a href="http://www.cea.mdx.ac.uk/">Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts</a>, has been researching the work of Edward Ihnatowicz and building an excellent <a href="http://www.senster.com/ihnatowicz/index.htm">archive</a> which is available online. I am so pleased that Alex is taking the time to research thoroughly how Ihnatowicz not just built the Senster but developed its behaviours. It was a truely ground breaking piece of work that is still a source of inspiration for artists and roboticists today.\n\n<a href="http://www.senster.com/ihnatowicz/senster/sensterphotos/index.htm">Photo Gallery</a> | <a href="http://www.senster.com/ihnatowicz/senster/senstercomputer/index.htm">System Details including Original Code</a> | <a href="http://www.senster.com/ihnatowicz/senster/sensterstructure/index.htm">Structural Design</a>\n\nIhnatowicz''s interest in the kinetics stemmed from his conviction that the behaviour of something tells us far more about it than its appearance. This led him to build the Senster, one of the most influential kinetic sculptures ever made. It consisted of a fifteen-foot-long steel frame articulated in six different places, with the joints all powered by hydraulics. On the Senster''s ''head'' were an array of microphones and a Doppler radar system.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/senster2.jpg" alt="senser edward ihnatowicz" />\n\nThe Honeywell mini-computer controlling the mechanism was programmed to make it react to three things: moderate and low sounds, loud sounds, and fast motion. Moderate sounds the head would move towards, loud sounds it would pull back from, and fast motion it would track. The result was an uncanny resemblance to a living thing, and the crowds at the Evoluon in Eindhoven, Holland, where it was on show reacted with enormous excitement. Children would shout and wave at it, call it names, and even throw things. Ihnatowicz explains that its movements seemed to stem from situations that people recognized.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/senster3.jpg" alt="senser edward ihnatowicz" />\n\nIn the quiet of the early morning the machine would be found with its head down, listening to the faint noise of its own hydraulic pumps. Then if a girl walked by the head would follow her, looking at her legs. Ihnatowicz described his own first stomach-turning experience of the machine when he had just got it working: he unconsciously cleared his throat, and the head came right up to him as if to ask, ''Are you all right?'' He also noticed a curious aspect of the effect the Senster had on people. When he was testing it he gave it various random patterns of motion to go through.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/senster4.jpg" alt="senser edward ihnatowicz" />\n\nChildren who saw it operating in this mode found it very frightening, but no one was ever frightened when it was working in the museum with its proper software, responding to sounds and movement. Although the Senster was dismantled some years ago, many people who saw it still remember vividly what a strong impression it made on them. Edward Ihnatowicz died in 1988. Alex Zivanovic currently continues to build on the archive as well as running science and technology education events and his own firm <a href="http://www.az-consultants.com/">AZ Consultants</a>, supporting the development of mechatronics projects for medical and industrial applications.\n\n<a href="http://www.senster.com/index.htm">Edward Ihnatowicz Archive</a>', 'Edward Ihnatowicz - The Senster', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'edward-ihnatowicz-the-senster', '', '', '2008-01-15 00:02:13', '2008-01-14 23:02:13', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/edward-ihnatowicz-the-senster.html', 0, 'post', '', 7),

His individual research is dedicated to a future vision of the body in architecture, questioning the contemporary relationship between the human flesh and the architectural flesh. In a time when a pervasive discourse about the impact of digital technologies risks turning the architectural ‘skin’ ever more disembodied, his aim is to put forward the notion of a Thick Embodied Flesh by exploring architectural interfaces that are truly inhabitable.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/cruz4.jpg" alt="marcos cruz" />\n\nConceptually his work delves into the arena of disgust on which the notion of an aesthetic flesh is standing, and it explores new types of ''neoplasmatic'' conditions in which the future possibility of a neo-biological flesh lies.

Architecture therefore stands for the manifestation of the ambivalence of the transience and the after-effect of the notion of co-existence.

His works explores the perception of space, time and energy encompassing ideas from cybernetics, artificial life, interaction design, emergence, complexity and alchemy.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/brown4.jpg" alt="richard brown" />\nStatic Machine\n\nBetween 1995 and 2001 <a href="http://www.mimetics.com/">Richard</a> was a Research Fellow at the Royal College of Art where he created and exhibited three major interactive works Alembic (ICA 1998), Biotica (Siggraph 2000) and the Neural Net Starfish (Millennium Dome 2000). Whist at the RCA Richard also published the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1874175330/qid=1033113341/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-4514184-7394337?v=glance&n=507846">Biotica: Art, Emergence and Artificial- Life</a>“. He has been an Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the Victorian College of Art, Melbourne University, and artist-in-residence at CEMA (Centre for Electronic Media Arts), Monash University.In 2006 Richard was invited by Edinburgh Informatics to be their first Research Artist in Residence. In this role, he has developed projects combining art, informatics and communications research.\n\nHere are a selection of projects of his but you can see many more at the Pask Present Exhibition.\n\n<strong>Electromagnetic Time Machine 1983</strong>\n\nAn electromagnetic kinetic sculpture using the cybernetic principle of regulatory feedback to generate complex oscillatory behaviour. Each electromagnetic relay is physically coupled to a vertical pendulum and electrically influenced by its immediate neighbour. When a relay closes it causes the relay in front to close only if the relay behind is open, thus creating a regulatory feedback loop with unstable oscillations due to the differing physical weightings of the vertical pendulums. A simple PIR sensor activates the work, the pulsing lights indicating the closing and opening of each relay.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/brown3.jpg" alt="richard brown" />\n\nCybernetics concerns itself with any type of system that involves sensing and feedback, biological, ecological, mechanical and chemical. Gordon Pask created cybernetic feedback mechanisms using electromechanical and analogue components in his works, such as “Colloquy of mobiles” in the same vein, Time Machine represents an alternative paradigm to the digital.\n\n\n<strong>Dendritics I, II and III</strong>\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/brown.jpg" alt="richard brown" />\n\nThe Electrochemical System is inspired by Gordon Pask’s early experiments with electrochemistry. The central negatively charged copper electrode of each glass is surrounded by four positively charged copper electrodes. Copper dendrites grow from the central electrode reaching out to the outer electrodes. The plates are connected so that each glass is in competition with the other, more charge being consumed by the fastest growing dendrite. Each outer electrode is connected via an LED whose brightness indicates the voltage difference.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/brown2.jpg" alt="richard brown" />\n\nThis work represents an experiment in using dendritic growth as self regulating switching mechanisms, as a dendrite grows, it consumes more potential in competition with other dendrites trying to grow from the same power source. Pask describes the possibilities of chemical computing, the energy systems involved and illustrates a number of circuit possibilities for dendritic circuits on pp 105–108 in his book “An approach to Cybernetics”, Pask 1961.', 'Richard Brown', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'richard-brown', '', '', '2008-03-24 14:22:11', '2008-03-24 14:22:11', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/richard-brown.html', 0, 'post', '', 1),

The system uses speakers and panels of resonating metal and gains its input and mode of operation through the cyclical feedback of sound waves from the environment in which it is placed. It is extremely reactive and capable of changing in real-time to anything that alters the acoustic properties of the environment that it exists within.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/rick2.jpg" alt="richard roberts" />\n<ul>\n<em>Richard using one of his electro-acoustic systems to explore the sonic properties of Fort Brockhurst, Portsmouth</em></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough this work Richard describes how he "discovered that sound is an effective method with which one can explore first and second order cybernetic principles, and that any observer is an integral and inescapable part of their own acoustic space."

Most are viewer-activated or driven by electric motors. All are driven by a wry sense of humor or a probing philosophical concept.\n\n<ol>\n“When making a sculpture,” Ganson says, “It’s always a challenge to say enough but not say too much, to coax with some kind of recognizable bait, then leave the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions and thereby find personal meaning.”</ol>\n\n\n\n<embed src="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/mediaplayer.swf" flashvars="file=http://media.ebaumsworld.com/2006/06/wishbone.flv&displayheight=321&image=http://media.ebaumsworld.com/2006/06/wishbone75.jpg" loop="false" menu="false" quality="high" bgcolor="#ffffff" width="425" height="345"  type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" />\n\nMoving objects are playfully linked by intention and subject in A Child and a Ball, which entails an active child mesmerized by a moving ball. In Machine with Wishbone, a real chicken wishbone pulls the very mechanism responsible for its movement. Another sculpture writes the word “Faster” as it is pushed. Other works explore the nature of oiled surfaces, object manipulation, slow explosions, and the organic implications of slow moving roller chain.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/ganson.jpg" alt="ganson image" width="450"/>\n\nIn a profile of Ganson in Smithsonian Magazine, David Sims described the sculptor’s work as “retrotechnology with a nineteenth-century quality.... No lasers, no subminiaturized computer wizardry. What you see is what you get,” and, Sims added, ‘People generally get what they see because there are so many different points of entry, an end result of the playful Ganson mind....Kids love Machine with Wishbone because it’s funny, odd, and ingenious. Many adults, on the other hand, see pathos and tragedy as the enslaved little bone drags the clanking contraption behind it.

The whole project was initiated and directed by Le Corbusier, who also created and/or selected the images for the audiovisual show, with the organized sound composed by Edgar Varèse, and the stunning surfaces of the building designed by Iannis Xenakis.

The key features of these moulds are regular geometry, tiered designs and plastic forms. Forget all this!

But remember there is fine line between outstanding ‘wobble factor’ and disaster. You can design one jelly, a series of jellies or perhaps a jelly that can be repeated for a particular effect: the choice is yours.\n\nmore information <a href="http://www.jellymongers.co.uk/competition.html">here</a>', 'Jellytecture', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'jellytecture', '', '', '2008-04-20 12:16:24', '2008-04-20 12:16:24', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=408', 0, 'post', '', 1),

Weizenbaum was best known for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>, a program designed in 1966 to establish natural language conversation with a computer by emulating a Rogerian therapist (Online Version of <a href="http://nlp-addiction.com/eliza/">ELIZA</a>). Weizenbaum was the first to note that the ELIZA conversations weren''t an example of computer "thinking," but really consisted of some clever programming techniques. His argument that computers were merely tools to assist humans in their everyday lives put him in opposition to many of the leading researchers in the emerging field of artificial intelligence.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/joe.jpg" alt="weizenbaum" />\n\nA few years after he wrote ELIZA, the idea of the thinking computer gained popular credence. A famous article in Life magazine in 1970 entitled "Meet Shakey, the First Electronic Person" was testament to this. Shakey was a Stanford University robot and one of Weizenbaum''s colleagues at MIT was quoted in the Life article as saying: "In from three to eight years we will have a machine with general intelligence of an average human being."\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/joe3.jpg" alt="weizenbaum" />\nShakey the Robot was the first mobile robot to be able to reason to some degree about its own actions.\n\nSoon, the popular media was trumpeting the impending arrival of thinking machines and it was left largely to Weizenbaum to put the issue in perspective and to note that computers as thinking machines weren''t right around the corner. He drew more fire from the AI community from his book, "Computer Power and Human Reason" that argued in part that man from the view of information processing is looked at as a means and not as an end. He worried that many computer scientists were following paths that were dehumanizing. Weizenbaum argued, essentially, that computers impose a mechanistic point of view on their users  on us and that that perspective can all too easily crowd out other, possibly more human, perspectives.\n\n<object width="450" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/F2lPVP2VYBU&hl=en&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/F2lPVP2VYBU&hl=en&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object>\n\nWeizenbaum considered himself a gadfly and even heretic of the artificial intelligence community, which has had soaring flights and deep drops in acceptance and interest since he wrote ELIZA in the mid-1960s. AI currently is in a down draft as the firms that were built around it in the 1980s have largely faded from view.

I have to say that it is extremely powerful and a great introduction to C++ programming.  “OpenFrameWorks, is a new open source, cross platform, c++ library, which was designed by Zachary Lieberman (US) and Theo Watson (UK) to make programming in c++ for students accessible and easy. In it, the developers wrap several different libraries like opengl for graphics, quicktime for movie playing and capturing, and free type for font rendering, into a convenient package in order to create a simple, intuitive framework for creating projects using c++. It is designed to work in freely available compilers, and will run under any of the current operating systems” Coming from a processing.org background which has satisfied all my needs till now, I really got interested in openFrameworks because of my increasing use of computer vision. While I never had the confidence to use C++ from scratch, to build computer vision software, openFrameworks offers a lot of the building blocks to let you go straight to the design phase.

The Sarcophagus is one materialization of this project. It is a mobile sepulchre that holds and displays portraits of those who wish to have their informational remains cross over into a digital afterlife. The size of a standard cargo container that can travel to any location in the world, the Sarcophagus has an immersive LED screen covering its walls, ceiling and floor. There, interactive digital portraits can be summoned via mobile phone or web browser from virtual capsules that are stored in the shared memory of thousands of networked electronic devices of Mission Eternity Angels (people who contribute a small part of their personal storage capacity to the mission, currently 765 of them; to date, 2 volunteers have been accepted for encapsulation).\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/vida3.jpg" alt="vida" />\n\nThe data spectres that populate this tenuous memorial space are composed of details of lives lived, in visual, audio and text fragments. But when they are summoned in lo-res pixellated form in the Sarcophagus, they resemble one merged personality. The massing of details that we find in archives and records that keep the dead with us has a similar compositing effect, yet the Sarcophagus is also very unlike those. It gives us access to a novel social world generated among networked computer users who have a common goal of keeping something alive, which can invoke intense feelings such as care and wonder.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/vida4.jpg" alt="vida" />\n\n\n<strong>ALAVS 2.0</strong>\n\nJed Berks’ Autonomous Light Air Vehicles combine many of the themes of artificial life and multi-agent robotics research in an accessible and elegant public presentation. These include capable powered navigation and obstacle avoidance, organized multi-agent behaviour (such as flocking), discernable (quasi) intelligent individual behaviour, and interaction with other (quasi) intelligent agents, i.e., people. Connecting these agendas with more contemporary interest in mobile and locative technologies, Berk has implemented human-ALAV communication via mobile phone technology. The rigors of such a project must not be elided.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/vida5.jpg" alt="vida" />\n\nWhile robots in research-lab contexts often exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are just as often delicate, unreliable and require the constant attention of one or several highly trained staff. A project like ALAVs must exhibit its qualities in the general public, must inform and entertain, and at the same time be robust and resilient to the unpredictabilities of unusual architectures and architectural materials, weather, children and crowds (and sometimes, animals) - influences which are almost always filtered out in the controlled environment of the lab.\n\n<img src="/assets/2008/vida6.jpg" alt="vida" />\n\nThe ALAVs achieve all this, while remaining lighter than air, an achievement in itself given the weight of batteries and other components. The ALAVs are beguilingly delicate translucent agents which drift and float in a most un-robotic way. <a href="http://www.alavs.com/videos.html">Videos</a>', 'VIDA ', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'vida', '', '', '2008-04-23 00:27:36', '2008-04-23 00:27:36', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=399', 0, 'post', '', 1),

The aim of the project is to investigate how electrostatic energy could either be effectively utilised or play a part in the development of active, responsive and interactive textile systems which would be capable of detecting, translating and displaying this energy into dynamic audio-visual patterns. This design pilot project studies the possible translations of electrostatic energy into other types of energy such as light, sound and motion using specially engineered intelligent textile systems as mediators and displays for these processes.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/estatic2.jpg" alt="estatic2" title="estatic2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-521" width="450" />\n\nThe electronic textile acts as a static mirror responding to the usually invisible charges generated by people interacting with materials and making them visible. Equipped with tiny LED lights, transistors and woven electronic circuits seamlessly integrated into the electronic textiles structure, the installation is able to create transient shadows on the textile display in areas which detect a presence of electrostatic fields, feeding on the charges created by viewers and objects. Simultaneously it acts as a simple sonic instrument in response to the presence and intensity of charges and human proximity.\n\nStatic electricity is one of the oldest known physical phenomena. The ancient Greeks noticed the amazing ability of amber, once rubbed, to attract light materials despite gravitational forces. Because of its electrostatic properties amber in Greek means ''electron''.\n\nFor a long time electrostatic continued to be a source of mystery and amazement, before the rational and scientific approach to understanding the world came about. In the early 17th century fascinating devices and machines that tread between the boundaries of magic and science, conceptually and perceptually, were evolved through the unravelling of static electricity, including the first electrostatic generator by Otto van Guericke. In 1901 various scientific experiments culminated into Dr. Nikola Tesla''s plan to wirelessly broadcast electrostatic power to the whole world from his facility at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower">Wardenclyffe</a> in New York.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/tesla.jpg" alt="tesla" title="tesla" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519" width="450"/>\nTeslas Wardenclyffe Facility\n\nPublic electrostatic demonstrations and performances easily became one of the crowds'' favourite entertainments in the 17th to 19th century due to its seemingly miraculous, contradicting experiences. Just one example is Stephen Gray''s experiment premiered in London in 1730.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/flyingboy.jpg" alt="flyingboy" title="flyingboy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-523" />\nThe famous "flying boy" used to demonstrate electrical polarity in suspended objects.\n\nHe suspended an eight year old boy in mid air, utilising the human body as a medium for static electricity, attracting paper and light objects to the boy''s negatively charged face and hands.

After a few weeks hunting for a site, he found a field, slipped the local farmer £200 and planted 3,600 square metres with tubes collected from hospitals.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/box.jpg" alt="box3" title="box3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-546" width="450" />\n\nA fluorescent tube glows when an electrical voltage is set up across it.

Because powerlines are typically 400,000 volts, and Earth is at an electrical potential voltage of zero volts, pylons create electric fields between the cables they carry and the ground.Box denies that he aimed to draw attention to the potential dangers of powerlines, ‘For me, it was just the amazement of taking something that’s invisible and making it visible,’ ', 'Richard Box', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'richard-box', '', '', '2009-04-09 00:09:24', '2009-04-09 00:09:24', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=543', 0, 'post', '', 1),

Ok... it has very little to do with interactive architecture, but I was so inspired by it that I decided to write about it anyway.\n\nThe thing that really struck me walking through the museum was the balance throughout. I don''t mean in a the-building-is-almost-falling-down-but-not kinda way: I''m referring to an unusually great combination of art and architecture, and how it felt.\n\n<img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-768" title="Museum Entrance" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/dsc02756-450x337.jpg" alt="Museum Entrance" width="450" height="337" />\n\nThe museum building was designed by a team made up of the architects Ruy Jervis d’Athouguia, Pedro Cid and Alberto Pessoa and hints (rather strongly) at inspiration from Mies van der Rohe. The building''s minimalist concrete form sits in a beautifully landscaped park, concealing bunker-like yet welcoming rooms of marble and wood floors and ceilings. Blinds obscuring the view to outside through floor to ceiling windows reduce the outside image almost to paintings.\n\n <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-773" title="View Through" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/dsc02701-450x337.jpg" alt="View Through" width="450" height="337" />\n\nInside, one of the most amazing art collections I''ve ever seen is actually given the space it deserves. The minimalist architecture is the perfect backdrop for an intricately crafted collection which includes everything from Egyptian treasures to Chinese and Japanese tapestries and ceramics, to Rembrants, Rubens'', and Monets. I''m not an art historian, by any stretch of the imagination, but clearly only the best was good enough for this collector.\n\n<img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-769" title="Vitrines" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/dsc02720-450x600.jpg" alt="Vitrines" width="450" height="600" />\n\n <img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-770" title="Daylit Ceramics" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/dsc02684-450x337.jpg" alt="Daylit Ceramics" width="450" height="337" />\n\nThat one man managed to gather this collection is unbelievable. That it has all ended up together in this setting is even more amazing. In a time when I''m thinking more and more about interactive and reactive installations, and the opportunities an increasing number of permanent commissions will bring, 2 hours walking through the Gulbenkian has reminded me in the significance of balance. Although completely static, save the variation of the small amount of natural light entering the museum, I would dare describe the resulting feeling of being in this museum as immersive. The combination of light, minimal architecture, a subtle connection to the surrounding landscape and an extremely detailed collection of artworks, drew everyone in a way I''ve rarely experienced. I could go on about this forever but I won''t - I guess I just look forward to seeing more and more interactive installations that find this balance too.', 'Gulbenkian', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'gulbenkian', '', '', '2009-06-10 00:03:44', '2009-06-09 23:03:44', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=767', 0, 'post', '', 2),

Finally he''s put together a website so I thought I''d cover 2 recent pieces of his work. Jimenez describes his work as an exploration of "hypothetical scenarios of experimental architecture. By pressing alternate conditions against our context, the projects aim at interrogating different points of views and broaden the ways we engage conventions. Graphic novels and physical installations are the two primary weapons of choice, and we believe representation is more than half the battle. The drawings often explore storylines of architecture and urbanism that dramatize exaggerated realities. The projects swerve back into the physical world via the interactive installations derived from the stories. These installations are attempts to better understand the spatial implications of the two-dimensional fiction."\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/phalanstery02-450x674.jpg" alt="phalanstery02" title="phalanstery02" width="450" height="674" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-796" />\n\n<strong>Phalanstery Module</strong>\n\nThis installation grown from the hypothesizes that in zero-gravity, one can rotate (in) architecture and treat all elevations as plans - i.e., walls, ceilings and floors. Without gravity, all surfaces can be occupied. In essence, the distinctions between orthographic drawings become obsolete. To this end the installation will be a large constantly rotating structure which visitors will be able to approach and use differently every time.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/ark02.jpg" alt="ark02" title="ark02" width="444" height="590" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-791" />\n\nThe installation is inspired by a comic book Lai created to assert commentaries regarding the Broadacre City-- a 1932 Frank Lloyd Wright vision of a Utopian city where each family own a one-acre agrarian plot and commutes by private automobile. Wright never really took into account that space and natural resources are limited. We are witnessing such an impact today. Wealthier citizens have fled cities for sprawling suburban sub-divisions.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/phalanstery-450x397.jpg" alt="phalanstery" title="phalanstery" width="450" height="397" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-795" />\n\nDowntown cores are left to the poor, and cities are becoming increasingly ineffective in controlling energy consumption. Lai takes Broadacre City to outer space. Flipping it on its side and making it an Ark are ways he signifies that resources are finite. It is a world where every man (gets) a dwelling unit and every man (gets) a pointlessly boring job... until the citizen dies.”\n\n\n<strong>Point Clouds</strong>\n\nThis project uses a set of standard modules and simple geometric rules to compose a system. The com- plexity Lies within the softness of the connection points.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/PC_03-450x417.jpg" alt="PC_03" title="PC_03" width="450" height="417" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-793" />\n\nWhen force is applied to one rotary joint, the entire structure will respond with further geometrical transformations. Softness allows the piece to be interactive, as visitors can converse with the impermanence of its form. Affordances, as defined by psychologist James J. Gibson, embody all action possibilities latent in the environment, objectively measurable and independent of the individual’s ability to recognize them.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/pclouds01a-450x300.jpg" alt="pclouds01a" title="pclouds01a" width="450" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-794" />\n\nDimensions, in this case, has various meanings in the many ways our bodies may instinctively inform actions such as lean, sit, grab, skip or pull. Any storyline of the above appropriations will have a physical morphology in the diagram. Self-illuminating pigments are applied to the control points to highlight its topology at night. This project engages the limits of the body as abstractions of architectural programs and their relationships to the formal resolutions.

The final installation "Computing an Identity" is a Memory Theatre (a reference to Giulio Camillo''s Renaissance masterpiece), which uses delayed images of the self to question the observer''s own memory.\n\n<object width="450" height="259"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5466501&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5466501&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="450" height="259"></embed></object>\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/tetsuro4-450x674.jpg" alt="tetsuro4" title="tetsuro4" width="450" height="674" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-844" />\n\nThe installation is a processional experience, beginning with a spotlight that initially appears to display your shadow. The shadow then begins to delay questioning the observer''s perception of things that we take for granted. If the observer stays still, his shadow is merged into one of a previous occupant of the space.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/tetsuro31-450x454.jpg" alt="tetsuro3" title="tetsuro3" width="450" height="454" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-848" />\n\nThe procession moves on towards a delayed mirror, which shortens its delay the closer you get to it. At a certain distance, the reflection becomes clearer, and the observer is able to directly compare their delayed reflection with their real one.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/tetsuro2-450x595.jpg" alt="tetsuro2" title="tetsuro2" width="450" height="595" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-842" />\n\nThe piece culminates with a ''rose window'' which captures observers'' faces, and reveals to the individual, his position within the long-term memory of the space.

The individual procession references that of a church; from nave, to altar, and exiting through the West door. Nagata explains that "One of my initial aims was to question where bodily and facial images have gone from contemporary architecture, and as devices that trigger your memory, what their role is in a society obsessed with storing memories in external appliances."', 'Computing an Identity - Tetsuro Nagata', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'computing-an-identity-tetsuro-nagata', '', '', '2009-07-15 00:05:21', '2009-07-14 23:05:21', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=839', 0, 'post', '', 2),

The wine estate in Fläsch follows the terroir principle. This principle states that the local colour – soil, microclimate, local traditions and the winegrower’s trademark – is directly reflected by the wine. A sensitive handling of space, temperature and light is therefore necessary.

A few seconds later, and your code is a fully functional demo sitting alongside what you''ve just written. This in itself is a major step, bearing in mind where flash came from: a big old application for timeline animation.

About 1,900 of these modules contain a regular matrix of compact fluorescent light tubes forming “active patches” within the façade. At night the light matrix superimposes the idiosyncratic physical structure of the white, crystalline daytime façade. But the irregular arrangement of these patches – dividing the façade into areas with different resolutions – does not create a large, homogeneous screen in front of the building, but instead forms a more general impression of the building’s “medianess” as an addition to and an essential ingredient of its architecture."\n\n<img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-988" title="CMesh02" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/DSC_0042_adj-450x298.jpg" alt="CMesh02" width="450" height="298" />\n\nrealities:united are probably best known for the <a href="http://realities-united.de/#PROJECT,69,1">BIX</a> facade the created for Kunsthaus Graz (Austria) in 2003, and since then have built up a great body of work exploring an expanding world of ornamental media architecture. Whilst I still have a soft spot for the BIX project, one of the things that I really like about Crystal Mesh is the way that realities:united have created a sculptural facade where each pixel is in fact not one pixel at all, but an animatable cluster of them. The result is a kind of sub-resolution, where each crystal in the mesh can act as one object, or it''s subpixels can be individually controlled to create a really unique movement of light across the surface of the facade.\n\n<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="225" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473657&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="225" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=3473657&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>\n\n<a href="http://vimeo.com/3473657">CRYSTAL MESH</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/autokolor">autokolor</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.\n\nIn the crystal mesh project realities:united once again shy away from jumping on the LED bandwagon like (most of) the rest of the world, and stick with good old fluorescent lamps.

Artifacts and systems we interact with on a daily basis collect, store, and process information about us, or are activated by our movements and transactions. Ubiquitous computing evangelists herald a coming age of urban infrastructure capable of sensing and responding to the events and activities transpiring around them. Imbued with the capacity to remember, correlate and anticipate, this near-future “sentient” city is envisioned as being capable of reflexively monitoring its environment and our behavior within it, becoming an active agent in the organization of everyday life in urban public space.\n\nToward the Sentient City explores alternate trajectories for the design and inhabitation of this near-future urban environment.

I am delighted to be the first person to be publishing his work in my recently release book "<a href="http://www.passagesthroughhinterlands.com/">Digital Architecture: Passages Through Hinterlands</a>". Nick''s work really is out on the hinterlands, a landscape plighted by climate change and rising water levels, social order breaks down, resources become rationed and public space becomes further militarised to maintain social order. Set in the Blackwater Estuary, Essex, his allegorical and provocative defensive architectures envisage the construction of a set of austere coastal defence towers that perform multiple functions within this dystopian future.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/nick-08-450x630.jpg" alt="nick 08" title="nick 08" width="450" height="630" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1052" />\n\nThe militarised towers are alive — breathing, creaking, groaning, sweating and crying when stressed. Airbags on the face of the towers expand and contract, while hundreds of tensile trunks are sporadically activated, casting water onto the heated facades producing steam. An empty watchtower at the top of each tower gives the impression that the fragile landscape below is being constantly surveyed.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/nick-06-450x630.jpg" alt="nick 06" title="nick 06" width="450" height="630" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1056" />\n\nAcross the estuary, a bed of salt marshes provides a natural form of flood defence and habitats for wildlife. Due to rising water levels and adverse weather conditions, the salt marshes are quickly deteriorating. The proposal suggests that mega structures can be integrated into, and encourage, the growth of natural defence mechanisms.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/nick-04-450x630.jpg" alt="nick 04" title="nick 04" width="450" height="630" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1053" />\n\nOver time, sand is collected at the base of each tower to form a spit across the mouth of the estuary, absorbing energy from the waves. Internally, the towers serve as a vast repository for mankind’s most valuable asset — knowledge. The architecture is an ark, protecting books from cumulative and catastrophic deterioration.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/Nicholas-Szczepaniak12-450x688.jpg" alt="Nicholas Szczepaniak12" title="Nicholas Szczepaniak12" width="450" height="688" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1054" />\n\nEarly experiments with sugar and caramel were used to develop a prototypical object that responds to its surrounding climate. When heat is applied to sugar, its molecular arrangement is changed to form caramel. A series of experiments with domestic objects demonstrated how molten caramel can be extruded in a state of tension, then left to set to act in compression. Thin sheets, up to one metre in height, were also formed and then hung as a curtain. Responding to environmental conditions, these objects would crack, split, absorb moisture and dilapidate. They became indicators of climate change and became beacons of abnormal environmental conditions.\n\n<img src="/assets/2009/Nicholas-Szczepaniak14-450x646.jpg" alt="Nicholas Szczepaniak14" title="Nicholas Szczepaniak14" width="450" height="646" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1055" />\n\nSzczepaniak’s project identified repetition, control, anticipated tension and surveying from an elevated position as properties crucial to his architecture. These evolved through an intensive process of speculative drawing, model making and a series of analogue and digital collage techniques. Studies were made of defensive typologies, in particular watchtowers and the Maze prison, built at the height of the Northern Irish Conflict...

The exhibition, co-curated by onedotzero, showcases the latest developments in digital and interactive design, from small screen based graphics to large-scale installations.\n\n<img class="size-full wp-image-1079 alignnone" title="V&amp;A Poster" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/59463-large.jpg" alt="V&amp;A Poster" width="263" height="298" />\n\nExhibition poster: Prototypes from the Flowers series, 2009 Daniel Brown\n\nI was lucky enough to get my hands on a ticket to the opening and whilst not everything in the show was my kettle of fish, a few works really stood out. I''ll focus on those.\n\nDaniel Rozin''s Weave Mirror installation was one of the highlights for me. Ok- I''ve seen about a million pictures of it (check out Troika''s Digital by Design book, for instance) but I''d never seen it in person. Beautifully done- the work had a really organic feeling to it despite the somewhat complex network of electronics carefully integrated into the back. If there was one ''I put my hand up, you show me putting my hand up'' installation I''d want in my house, it''d be this one.\n\n<img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1080" title="weavemirror" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/weavemirror-450x344.jpg" alt="weavemirror" width="450" height="344" />\n\n<a href="http://www.smoothware.com/danny/" target="_blank">http://www.smoothware.com/danny/</a>\n\nEqually worthy of mention was Troika''s Digital Zoetrope, originally commissioned for onedotzero''s 2008/09 festival. From Troika''s website:\n\n"The idea for the zoetrope comes directly from the festivals ''adventures in motion'' payoff and this year’s theme ''Citystates''."\n\n"We wanted to create a container that both celebrated the heritage of motion arts as well as its digital present while affording us a very literal medium for the content – the idea of altered states through motion."\n\n<img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1081" title="Troika_ODZ - 60Hz" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/Troika_ODZ-60Hz-450x337.jpg" alt="Troika_ODZ - 60Hz" width="450" height="337" />\n\n<a href="http://troika.uk.com/" target="_blank">http://troika.uk.com/</a>\n\nAt the slightly more aggressive end of the scale, Ryoji Ikeda''s piece in the show was probably my favourite. Ok. Equal favourite. I saw him Live at the Paradiso in Amsterdam a couple of years ago and whilst I must say that I can generally handle experimental music, this really tested me. The set was about half an hour long and after 20 minutes I was unsure if I was going to make it to the end. I loved every second of it, but it was so intense.\n\nHe describes his work at the V&amp;A, data.scan, as an attempt to materialise the vast quantities of data surrounding us in our everyday lives. It is part of Ikeda’s ongoing datamatics series, a collection of works that investigate the minutiae and infinite qualities of data.\n\nFor the sound element of the work, Ryoji opts for high frequencies which cut through even the chaos of the opening night, in a room which was probably already a little over-crowded with works before it was filled with people.\n\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1082" title="data.scan" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/MG_8729_large-2.jpg" alt="data.scan" width="450" height="250" />\n\n<a href="http://www.ryojiikeda.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ryojiikeda.com/</a>\n\nDecode is on now at the V&amp;A and runs through to April 11, 2010.

Whistling is a kind of time travel to a less articulated state. Inhabitants of Gomera, one of the Canary Islands, use a whistling language, el Silbo Gomera, to communicate from hilltop to hilltop. Their powerful whistles travel farther than the spoken word. We share whistling and song with many animals. Mammals and birds carry the means for whistling in them. Just as we carry physical remnants of our bodily evolution in us, we carry the capacity for whistling in us.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/emergence-art-and-artificial-life.html/two_uwms" rel="attachment wp-att-1098"><img src="/assets/2009/two_uwms-450x362.jpg" alt="" title="two_uwms" width="450" height="362" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1098" /></a>\n\nU.W.M (The Universal Whistling Machine) is an investigation into the vexing problem of human-machine interface design. Whistling is much closer to the phoneme-less signal primitives compatible with digital machinery than the messy domain of spoken language. As opposed to pushing machines into engaging humans in spoken language, U.W.M. suggests we meet on a middle ground. Whistling occurs across all languages and cultures. All people have the capacity to whistle, though many do not whistle well. Lacking phonemes, whistling is a pre-language language, a candidate for a limited Esperanto of human-machine communication. Beyond alternatives to computer interfaces, U.W.M. also offers the potential for a new approach to human-animal communication. U.W.M. is capable of imitating certain bird whistles as easily as it can synthesize human whistles. Could this lead to new forms of human-machine-animal exchanges?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Emergence - Art and Artificial Life ', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'emergence-art-and-artificial-life', '', '', '2009-12-21 00:38:25', '2009-12-20 23:38:25', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=1088', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Different states emerge from this complex system. These states are defined not only by the interaction of the robots with the spectators, but also by the interaction of the robots with their neighboring pairs. I''ve been looking into CA based physical environments for a while with a few of my students who''ve been building them at the Bartlett''s <a href="http://www.aac.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/">Adaptive Architecture & Computation</a> course (<a href="http://marilenaskavara.wordpress.com/">Marilena Skavara</a> & <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/4980646">Kensuke Hotta</a>) but Leo Nunez''s piece deals with the interaction of CA systems in such a wonderfully analog way which is rarely seen today.\n\n<object width="450" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/A5jD0sVbYE0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/A5jD0sVbYE0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="450" height="360"></embed></object>\n\nThis work system also tries to investigate the man machine relation. The robots are  unmanageable objects; thus, the control of these escapes the individuals and remains in the system itself, in the propagation of the information between the objects. The interaction of the users is mediated by a luminous interface keeping the body of the user away from the robots.  This distance emphasizes the notion of the unmanageable objects, establishing a man-machine relation only mediated and more and more distant.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/leo-nunez-emergence-exhibition.html/propaga-03" rel="attachment wp-att-1112"><img src="/assets/2009/Propaga-03-450x337.jpg" alt="" title="Propaga 03" width="450" height="337" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1112" /></a>\n\nEach automaton is molded into a small robotic sculpture. The shape is given by the different electronic components necessary for its functionality. All the robots share the same electronic circuit design, but in their formality they are all different. Each cell or robot is constructed with Low-tech technology. This decision seeks to create a speech that establishes itself in a context of social criticism, generating an argument on the difference in the technology availability between the countries of the first world and the Latin American countries.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/leo-nunez-emergence-exhibition.html/propaga-05" rel="attachment wp-att-1113"><img src="/assets/2009/Propaga-05-450x337.jpg" alt="" title="Propaga 05" width="450" height="337" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1113" /></a>\n\nLeo Nuñez studied Systems engineering and image and sound design.

Sniff is an interactive projection: an animated dog follows passers-by, discerns their behavior as friendly or aggressive, tries to engage them and forms a relationship with them based on the history of the interaction. As the viewer walks by the projection, their movements and gestures are tracked by a computer vision system.

Our automatic interpretation of behavior as social interaction is especially emblematic in a non-linguistic engagement with the ''other'', which in case of Sniff produces a hybrid space of virtual and real emotions, social guess-work and mind modeling.  Sniff is an attempt to trigger an intense, playful and insightful level of engagement at which we solve the "other minds" problem in everyday life.  Sniff is inserted into our physical reality and follows its rules.\n', 'Sniff - Emergence Exhibition', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'sniff-emergence-exhibition', '', '', '2009-12-23 00:09:44', '2009-12-22 23:09:44', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=1125', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Size, quality, timbre, texture and the atmosphere of a space can all be inferred by the way in which we experience sound. Based on ideas from the Suffolk island of Orford Ness, Ric Lipson''s acoustic theatre ''Hear Here" has been developed over a preoccupation with the acoustic qualities of circular spaces and ambient sonic landscapes. His work features in ''<a href="http://www.passagesthroughhinterlands.com/">Digital Architecture: Passages Through Hinterlands</a>''.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/hear-here-%e2%80%93-an-acoustic-theatre-ric-lipson.html/hearhere3" rel="attachment wp-att-1142"><img src="/assets/2009/hearhere3.jpg" alt="" title="hearhere3" width="450" height="301" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1142" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.riclipson.com/">Ric Lipson</a>''s Hear Here concerns itself with sound and the body aiming to generate a physical construct that, while taking physics, music and architecture into account, sets out to explore how space can be understood through sound. If architecture is the manipulation of space, then the built form is a way of capturing the ambient. At the core of this question is the way space is experienced as a function of the sounds found both within and around the space, and the sounds that result from occupancy of the space.\n\n<object width="450" height="280"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iWzovIXHr-s&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iWzovIXHr-s&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="450" height="280"></embed></object>\n\nThe building is the final movement in the score of this experiential journey concerning itself with sound and the body. By giving concepts physical form, the experience can be explored. It is a tourable, demountable structure. By exploring concepts of resonance, reflection, absorption, forced and natural, the work creates a ‘sonic geography’ framed within a physical construct that invites you to explore, listen, improvise and experience.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/hear-here-%e2%80%93-an-acoustic-theatre-ric-lipson.html/hearhere4" rel="attachment wp-att-1143"><img src="/assets/2009/hearhere4-450x301.jpg" alt="" title="hearhere4" width="450" height="301" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1143" /></a>\n\nComprising a monocoque, aluminium, open cone wrapped within a closed, tensioned, plywood structure, the two spaces act in combination to echo the form of the ear. The outer ear is the space in-between the wooden and aluminium skin, and it has a soft acoustic. Sounds reflect around the walls in a whispering gallery-type nature. The audience follow the sounds around the dark outer corridor and are ‘cleansed’ of what John Cage would describe as the “chaos of the everyday sounds”. The journey around the structure leads the audience into the inner drum. The aluminium cone is open to the world. It is bright and metallic, both in form and acoustic.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/hear-here-%e2%80%93-an-acoustic-theatre-ric-lipson.html/hearhere2" rel="attachment wp-att-1144"><img src="/assets/2009/hearhere2.jpg" alt="" title="hearhere2" width="450" height="625" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1144" /></a>\n\nThis ''Acoustic Theatre'' combines the world of manufacture, with the ephemeral nature of the ambient. The structure becomes a frame for the sound to exist. The audience are invited to enter and listen. The inner metal skin acts as an instrument, listening to the outer world and playing it back through a set of speakers. These sounds reflect and reverberate around the space. Essentially the pavilion is an ear capturing sounds from its immediate environment. Its geometries can intensify, resonate and distort these found sounds and act as a passive instrument, playing sounds of the city based on the occupier’s position within the structure.\n', 'Hear Here – an acoustic theatre - Ric Lipson', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'hear-here-an-acoustic-theatre-ric-lipson', '', '', '2009-12-28 00:15:56', '2009-12-27 23:15:56', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=1140', 0, 'post', '', 0);

He draws upon elements such as light, water, ice, fog, arctic moss and lava rock to create works that shift viewer perception and sense of place. From light-filled environments to walk-in kaleidoscopes, Eliasson’s unique, experiential works explore the intersection between nature and science, and the boundary between the organic and the artificial.\n\n<a rel="attachment wp-att-1161" href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/olafur-eliasson-mca-sydney.html/screen-shot-2009-12-30-at-19-56-17"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1161" title="Notion Motion" src="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/2009/Screen-shot-2009-12-30-at-19.56.17-450x293.png" alt="" width="450" height="293" /></a>\n\n<em>Notion Motion, 2005</em>\n\nTake Your Time opened earlier this month and will go through until April 11, 2010.

One of the best things about working at the Bartlett are some of the extraordinary people that you spend time with day to day and while I often get lost in the science when Rachel explains her goals for a Living Architecture, I adore the passion and vision of a truly interactive architecture capable of continual conversation with it built and natural environment.\n\nKey to Armstrong’s work are protocells – little cells of fat that can be sprayed on a building, creating a sort of frosting. These are designed to trap carbon dioxide and solidify it, turning it into solid pearls of calcium carbonate or biolime or mock rock. This coating will protect the building and even mend cracks. These protocells could even be used to stop Venice sinking, says Armstrong. Her plan is that the cells would be programmed to solidify when they get to the bottom of the lagoon, shoring up the foundations of the buildings above and thereby supporting the sinking structures.

Thanks to the <a href="http://www.computer-arts-society.org/">Computer Arts Society</a> for sharing it with me.\n\n1. The sadness of most art is that it does not know its future. The sadness of computer art is that it does not know its past.\n\n2. Constraint is liberty; reduce to the maximum.\n\n3. If it looks just like, you know, ‘art’…it probably isn''t.\n\n4. Using state-of-the-art technology merely produces state-of-the-technology art.\n\n5. Those who use computers to make art need to understand art as well as computers.\n\n6. Most participative art is deeply authoritarian.\n\n7. The computer is best characterised not as an information processor but as a general-purpose representation processor.\n\n8. Marshall McLuhan, at least as filtered through his sound-bites, was often wrong. The medium is not the message, which is more often determined socially and psychologically by the recipient.\n\n9. If your system costs 10 000 € and mine 30 000 €, it does not follow that my art is thrice as good as yours.\n\n10. In an ideal world, New Media institutions would employ at least one non-technological artist.\n\n11. Are you pushing the frontiers of computational representation, or of contemporary art? Confusion rarely leads to success.\n\n12. 99% of computer art is meretricious nonsense. But then 99% of everything is meretricious nonsense.\n\n13. Self-imposed formal requirements are not inhibitive of expression.\n\n14. Post Modernism has never said that everything is of equal value, just that the contexts in which we identify or attribute value should be open to analysis.\n\n15. You know your amazing new computer art, rich in metaphors and analogies? It''s been done. Years ago. Without a computer.\n\n16. We lose dimensions and scale. The computer in art is immediate and almost always, however "global", local. Just as no well-found art school would be complete without computers, so every such institution should have a telescope and a microscope, connected to the computer or not.\n\n17. Making computer art too dangerous to sponsor would be a good way to go.\n\n18. Just as everyone has a novel inside them, many believe they have an artwork. The purpose of a good art school is to seek out these people and stop them.\n\n19. Using a computer merely to access the web is like using a Bugatti Veyron to deliver the papers.\n\n20. Many people think that graphic design is art. Art is undertaken for art-like reasons, graphic design for graphic design-like reasons. There may of course be overlap. There should never be confusion.\n\n21. Making the (arts) information revolution consists not only in enabling the control of the means of computer art production by art workers, but also in being kind, non-gouging and relatively honest. Without the latter, one may doubt commitment to the former.\n\n22. The best interactive art always makes you look at the participants.\n\n23. There is only one thing worse than studying art for the budding computer artist, and that is to study computers. Or vice versa.\n\n24. Art is not craft.\n\n25. What would be pretentious or nonsensical if one said it oneself does not become more worthy when spoken by a computer-generated avatar.\n\n26. Seen in the light of Guy Debord''s "The Society of the Spectacle", computer art is very spectacular indeed.\n\n27. Beware of computer art as farce repeating itself as history.\n\n28. There is no "normal" computer art, in the Kuhnian sense. It is in constant revolution, hence constantly evading scrutiny.\n\n29. When the first solitary Metro station was built in Paris, where could people travel to? They just admired the station.\n\n30. Bugs are good; as with fireflies, the fertile ones shed light.\n\n31. The Prix Pierre Gutzman, 100 000 Francs, was offered by the Institut de France in 1906 to the first person who could establish contact with extra-terrestrials; except with Martians, which would be too easy.\n\n32. ‘All that is solid floats into air’ is not a celebration of virtuality, but Marx ''n'' Engels'' prediction for late capitalism.\n\n33. A half developed Polaroid photo is different to half a digital photo. A half-finished pen-plotter drawing is different to a half-finished inkjet print.\n\n34. When art processes happen near-instantaneously, doing art becomes synonymous with correction and selection, later with celebration; rarely with creativity.\n\n35. Art is visual philosophy. But computer art is not visual computer philosophy.\n\n36. Revolutionary modes of interaction between humans and normative structures do not a revolution make.\n\n37. ''i'', the imaginary square root of minus 1, is to the real numbers as the computer is — or should be — to art.\n\n38. The purpose of the computer in art is to render it difficult and problematic, not easy.\n\n39. We do not admire Picasso''s Guernica or Goya''s The Third of May 1808 solely because of the techniques used, yet we are often invited to admire computer art for just that reason. Art that is deliberately content-free is one thing. Art that is accidentally, lumpenly content-free is another.\n\n40. Computer artist: the unemployable producing the unsaleable for the uninterested.\n\n41. Of course computers and other devices will never fully understand flowing, allusive conversation. But they won''t care.\n\n42. Many of the ‘objects’ of computer art are instances, illustrations, of some less tangible, invisible process. But it may be that the waveform should remain uncollapsed, the artwork staying undecideable, problematic, unobjectified. Lucy R. Lippard described the ‘dematerialization of the art object’ nearly 40 years ago.\n\n43. Never throw away any computer or peripheral equipment that is more than 15 years old. You may well come to need it.\n\nVia <a href="http://www.computer-arts-society.org/">CAS</a> & <a href="http://www.paul-brown.com/">Paul Brown</a>', '43 Dodgy Statements on Computer Art ', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', '43-dodgy-statements-on-computer-art', '', '', '2010-04-20 11:07:10', '2010-04-20 10:07:10', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=1349', 0, 'post', '', 2),

Cook, Greene and Webb met in 1961, collaborated on the first Archigram magazine, later inviting Herron, Chalk and Crompton to join them, and the magazine name stuck to them as a group.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the-archigram-archival-project.html/archigram-story-1" rel="attachment wp-att-1356"><img src="/assets/2009/Archigram-Story-1-450x427.jpg" alt="" title="Archigram Story-1" width="450" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1356" /></a>\n\nMore Than 200 Projects are included in the Archigram Archival Project. The AAP uses the group’s mainly chronological numbering system and includes everything given an Archigram project number. This comprises projects done by members before they met, the Archigram magazines (grouped together at no. 100), the projects done by Archigram as a group between 1961 and 1974, and some later projects.\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the-archigram-archival-project.html/archigram-story-2" rel="attachment wp-att-1357"><img src="/assets/2009/Archigram-Story-2-450x427.jpg" alt="" title="Archigram Story-2" width="450" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1357" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the-archigram-archival-project.html/archigram-story-3" rel="attachment wp-att-1358"><img src="/assets/2009/Archigram-Story-3-450x427.jpg" alt="" title="Archigram Story-3" width="450" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1358" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the-archigram-archival-project.html/archigram-story-4" rel="attachment wp-att-1359"><img src="/assets/2009/Archigram-Story-4-450x427.jpg" alt="" title="Archigram Story-4" width="450" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1359" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the-archigram-archival-project.html/archigram-story-5" rel="attachment wp-att-1360"><img src="/assets/2009/Archigram-Story-5-450x427.jpg" alt="" title="Archigram Story-5" width="450" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1360" /></a>\n\n<a href="http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the-archigram-archival-project.html/archigram-story-6" rel="attachment wp-att-1361"><img src="/assets/2009/Archigram-Story-6-450x427.jpg" alt="" title="Archigram Story-6" width="450" height="427" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1361" /></a>', 'The Archigram Archival Project', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-archigram-archival-project', '', '', '2010-04-20 13:01:01', '2010-04-20 12:01:01', '', 0, 'http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/?p=1353', 0, 'post', '', 1),

Then in 2000, I visited the Millennium Dome with all its interactive "Zones", I know it was given a lot of bad press but I loved the idea that there was an industry somewhere out there where people built interactive spaces. Yeah a lot of it lacked real content and the whole thing was a big failure but I just thought to myself, hey this is much cooler than making stuff that just appears on screen. Pretty unsure about how I could getting involved with this new interest, I chose to give up my place at the Bartlett School of Architecture which at degree level didn’t go into the depth I wanted in terms of digital media. I chose instead to go to MediaLab Arts (now re-branded Digital Arts and Technology) in Plymouth because the relationship between digital media and space was a major part of their research although the education wasn’t specifically architectural. The skills I learnt in HCI, programming, and design have transferred over seamlessly when I then spent my final year synthesizing this within an architectural framework. I’m now at the Bartlett working with architects on how to bring this all forward. Having come from a sculpture background originally I’ve enjoyed getting my hands dirty again.\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Is all architecture interactive?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Is a block of concrete interactive? I don’t think so, is a door or window interactive? Well no, there’s no intelligence in its activity. I once got told a story about how the Greater London Council some years ago banned the use of Polycarbonate as a façade material because some stupid kid got a brick and threw it at a see-through polycarbonate façade thinking it was glass. Of course the polycarbonate didn’t break, in fact the brick bounced straight back and cracked the kid in the head. Now no question the kid deserved it but the building didn’t make a valued judgment on whether the kid deserved the punishment. Interactive Architecture, for me is about the potential for digital systems to make decisions about our living environment and then influence that environment. Architecture as a whole discipline should aim to improve the environments we live and work in. Interactive Architecture is an extension of that dealing at the cutting edge of digital technology.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc04.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc05.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc06.jpg" alt="" /> <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: You have been writing regularly on the subject of interactive architecture for many months now, but how do you categorise it? How do you decide what is interactive architecture and what is not?</strong>\r\n\r\ninteractivearchitecture.org has a life of its own. Initially when I started it was very focused reporting on what could be easily identified as interactive architecture, i.e. interactive installations for large scale architectural projects such as BIX, at the Kunsthaus Graz in Austria, Toshio Iwai’s ICE (Interactive Communicative Experience) for the Bloomberg Headquarters in Tokyo, NOX’s Son-O-House or Jason Bruges’s Memory Wall at the Puerta America Hotel. Since then I’ve begun to widen the focus to include interactive furniture, experimental projects at universities and research groups, and interesting new materials that I believe will transform how we apply technology into the built environment right down to nanotechnology such as the Buckymobile – Nano-Car. Scale is an enormously interesting facet of interactive architecture because increasingly this technology is becoming invisible to the naked eye. One guy at the moment whose work I really like is Usman Haque. His project Haunt has no visible technology but using humidity, temperature, electromagnetic and sonic frequencies that parapsychologists have associated with haunted spaces, he’s attempting to make a very powerful experience within what seems an unexceptional space. As a whole I find projects that suggest a future where integration of digital systems into the fabric of the built environment, rather than having computers as distinct objects embody what interactive architecture is about. Hopefully this will enable people to move around and interact with computers more naturally than they currently do.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc07.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc08.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc09.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Following your experiences regularly writing about and viewing Interactive Architecture, Do you now think that, despite its flexible nature, Interactive Architecture now has a defined aesthetic? Do you think it can be compared to previous, more traditional movements in architecture?</strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t think that there is a particular aesthetic however it’s often the case that especially with low budget works that similar inputs such as camera tracking, an array of simple sensors and similar outputs such as data projectors, speakers, lighting etc are used. Also it is often the case that the software used is limited to high level languages shockwave, Max/MSP, etc. since most artists aren’t advanced coders so output can be limited. Having said this even within the limited number of input, processing and output tools I’ve named, there are virtually infinite combinations of outcomes to explore. Sure sometimes you can look at the aesthetic of a piece of work and say ‘Oh yes, that was done with that program’, and then a work starts to place itself aesthetically with a piece of software which is a shame. Professor Stephen Gage who runs the "Interactive Architecture Workshop" at the Bartlett School of Architecture, uses the word "Magic" as an aspiration. Interactive architecture should always aim to separate itself from its origins in a piece of software or other technology because when it’s impossible to work out exactly how something is happening, that’s where the magic comes in, that’s when the a project really ignites an exciting response.\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: We frequently hear of cyberspace, hyperspace, Virtual reality, hyperflexible space etc. All these terms (and more) fit within the sphere of interactive architecture. What is your opinion of this diversity? Is it a strength? A weakness?</strong>\r\n\r\nNone of these terms were coined specifically for interactive architecture. Terms like virtual reality, cyberspace, hypersurfaces etc. work as concepts within many facets of the arts in exploring the ‘digital age’. Interactive architecture actually resists strictly virtual or physical definitions. Instead it acts on the constantly shifting boundary between the two. Architects dECOi for example use the analogy of Liquid Crystal Displays which have a Smectic state which is the point at which a crystal is neatly ordered as a solid but exhibits fluid like flow. Marcos Novak uses the term Liquid Architecture while others go as far as to describe this flexible space as being energized to the point of being more like a gas. Personally practice drives my investigation and theory underpins it. My real heroes in Architecture are the guys who attempt to deal with the idea\r\ns of this unstable space by engaging with it in the built environment.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc10.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc11.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc12.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you describe for us 3 of your favourite / most interesting / most inspirational works and tell us how they affected your working practice, or perceptions of interactive architecture?</strong>\r\n\r\nMy work deals most with interactive physically reconfiguring architecture. Not many people tend to explore this particular facet of interactive architecture partly because of the complications that crop up working with moving parts and flexible materials but mainly because it can be extremely expensive. I’ve had to use appropriated technology like car window motors for example instead of pistons for actuators for my Reciprocal Space project. Unfortunately there’s a pay off with performance. Not every one can afford to use 900+ pistons like architects dECOi did for the Aegis Hyposurface. Tobi Schneidler’s RemoteHome was a piece that inspired me because it treated physical movement in a very personal way and suggested how we could communicate with each other through tele-presence in a subtle non-explicit way by embedding actuators into the furniture and walls of our homes. The guy who’s pushing interactive moving architecture most at the moment is Kas Oosterhuis who runs the ‘Hyperbody Research Group’ at Delft. His ideas speculate that eventually we will be able to build entire buildings capable of changing in form with flexible hypersurface skins. None of his built pieces quite match up to his virtual representations but I really respect his passion to actualize these ideas into physical pieces of architecture. The guy who’s not recognized enough is Cedric Price who was the first person to see the potential in interactivity combining with reconfigurable architecture. His ‘Fun Palace’ 1960, which was an enormous flexible environment for infinite possible events to occur in. Aesthetically it looks like a factory but was designed for the public to play around and engage with the architecture. "Choose what you want to do – or watch someone else doing it. Learn how to handle tools, paint, babies, machinery, or just listen to your favourite tune. Dance, talk or be lifted up to where you can see how other people make things work. Sit out over space with a drink and tune in to what’s happening elsewhere in the city. Try starting a riot or beginning a painting – or just lie back and stare at the sky." Cedric Price speaking about the Fun Palace. He was light years ahead of its time and influenced the work of contemporary architects from Richard Rogers and Rem Koolhaas, to Rachel Whiteread. He was also the first to experiment with buildings having their own artificial intelligence and emotional states and how this would influence reconfigurable architecture.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc13.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc14.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc15.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: How do you create the architecture of experience?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll architecture is experience, we create it for ourselves in how we move. <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you tell us about interactivity within architecture, especially with regard to your own work. Would your pieces have "worked" without interactivity? Would they have "worked" without architecture?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe most important aim for me is to build immersive environments that question the widely held notion that architecture is fixed. In reality architecture is in constant flux as people, the environment and now digital information flows in, out and around these built environments. I express this with kinetic responses but many others have used a whole array of visual, tactile and audio effects. I’ve been experimenting for some time now with using Bio-Feedback mechanisms to make these spaces as immersive as possible. If the response to your interaction is sent back to you in real time your bond with the space is increased, the space starts to work at your biological and psychological level of cognition. Interactivity is necessary to give intelligence to this process so that the feedback loop that occurs does not become predictable but instead grows in complexity as your experience of the space does. My work is always intended to inhabit an existing space and then create its own or augment the spatial experience of that architecture.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc16.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc17.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc18.jpg" alt="" width="148" /> <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: What projects are you currently working on, or hoping to work on in the near future?</strong>\r\n\r\nI’m designing my first full scale building with Paul Burres who’s a traditionally trained Architect. It’s an extremely interesting process. It’s a speculative project based on creating physical spaces which you then build immaterial spaces within that can reconfigure in real time as the inhabitants converse and move around. Interactive architecture is always cross-disciplinary and it’s rare if not unheard of for someone to create a project entirely on their own. Architecture as a melting pot between the arts and sciences has increasingly become a cross disciplinary platform for discussion and experimentation into our new ‘Digital Society’. That’s what makes it so exciting to be involved in. One day I’m speaking to a specialist on Laminar Air Flow, the next day an electronics engineer, the next day a composite rubber specialist and so on. Interactive reconfigurable kinetic architecture is my focus. My last project Reciprocal Space which was essentially a room where the walls changed shape in response to an inhabitants movements creating a performance much like two people dancing together. It’s a real challenge working with interactive physically reconfiguring space because of the lack of appropriate materials and technology available. Reciprocal Space was constructed out of 32 car window motors, hacked computer parts, sheets of latex and hundreds of meters of cabling. Hardly Hi-Tech but it worked although installing something like this for permanent installation into a building requires a great deal more rigor in terms of reliability and safety. When you begin to design for the built environment funny little things called building regulations begin to start to influence your practice, you have to start considering what happens in the event of a fire or a flood, and rightly so you have to make spaces that are accessible for people in wheelchairs and consider the safety of children. I don’t find these constraints limiting though, as its often when you start to put parameters within which you build these environments that you really begin to push yourself. As for the future, I’ve just started making a book without any digital technology in sight, just an experiment into how the book as a collection of 2D planes can create architectural experience using image, text, material, binding etc. I think it’s important to work on something small and delicate while you’re working on something monstrous like a building. It keeps you in touch with the 1:1 scale which you don’t get from drawing 1:100 scale plans and sections of buildings. <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: What do you see is the future for Interactive Architecture? You mention on your site that it is flexible and semi-permanent. Because of this transient sensibility will Interactive Architecture perhaps not be aro\r\nund for too long?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo far from it. It’s still seen by mainstream architects as a quirky add-on for those who can afford it. Until that changes it will be treated as novelty architecture like it was in the Millennium Dome. I think it’s beginning to get wider recognition as a valuable asset to the buildings where it has been used well and as the technology for these kinds of projects become cheaper, more powerful and importantly smaller to the point of becoming invisible I see it being embedded into wider mainstream architecture. The problem is making architects realize that you can do more with intelligent architecture than just control heating, airflow, and security systems. When I talk about it as semi-permanent I’m saying that it would arrogant and short sighted of any interactive architect to believe he can design an interactive installation that will have a fixed function for the same lifetime as a building. Simply because buildings last a long time and in their lifetimes their uses change. Technology and the way people use it changes too and so I believe good Interactive Architecture does one of two things. It either accepts its place in time and serves a function for that period and then either is replaced or it is kept as a historical artifact or it is an open system capable of change so as to adapt to the changing role of the fixed architecture it inhabits. Its important to recognize however that while technological obsolescence can almost be charted on a graph, the cultural obsolescence of existing and future examples of Interactive Architecture are much harder to predict. I hope the BIX is still running in 50 or a 100 years time even though it is already out of date in respect to the available technologies that can be used to build its hypersurfaces. I hope at the same time though that interactive architects can come up with more open systems capable of lasting or even exceeding the lifetime of the physical spaces they are initially built within.', 'HMC Interview Ruairi Glynn', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'hmc-interview', '', '', '2012-04-15 19:23:00', '2012-04-15 19:23:00', '', 0, 'http://ia.local/?page_id=1394', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Then in 2000, I visited the Millennium Dome with all its interactive "Zones", I know it was given a lot of bad press but I loved the idea that there was an industry somewhere out there where people built interactive spaces. Yeah a lot of it lacked real content and the whole thing was a big failure but I just thought to myself, hey this is much cooler than making stuff that just appears on screen. Pretty unsure about how I could getting involved with this new interest, I chose to give up my place at the Bartlett School of Architecture which at degree level didn’t go into the depth I wanted in terms of digital media. I chose instead to go to MediaLab Arts (now re-branded Digital Arts and Technology) in Plymouth because the relationship between digital media and space was a major part of their research although the education wasn’t specifically architectural. The skills I learnt in HCI, programming, and design have transferred over seamlessly when I then spent my final year synthesizing this within an architectural framework. I’m now at the Bartlett working with architects on how to bring this all forward. Having come from a sculpture background originally I’ve enjoyed getting my hands dirty again.\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Is all architecture interactive?</strong>\n\nNo. Is a block of concrete interactive? I don’t think so, is a door or window interactive? Well no, there’s no intelligence in its activity. I once got told a story about how the Greater London Council some years ago banned the use of Polycarbonate as a façade material because some stupid kid got a brick and threw it at a see-through polycarbonate façade thinking it was glass. Of course the polycarbonate didn’t break, in fact the brick bounced straight back and cracked the kid in the head. Now no question the kid deserved it but the building didn’t make a valued judgment on whether the kid deserved the punishment. Interactive Architecture, for me is about the potential for digital systems to make decisions about our living environment and then influence that environment. Architecture as a whole discipline should aim to improve the environments we live and work in. Interactive Architecture is an extension of that dealing at the cutting edge of digital technology.\n\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc04.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc05.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc06.jpg" alt="" width="148" /> <strong></strong>\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: You have been writing regularly on the subject of interactive architecture for many months now, but how do you categorise it? How do you decide what is interactive architecture and what is not?</strong>\n\ninteractivearchitecture.org has a life of its own. Initially when I started it was very focused reporting on what could be easily identified as interactive architecture, i.e. interactive installations for large scale architectural projects such as BIX, at the Kunsthaus Graz in Austria, Toshio Iwai’s ICE (Interactive Communicative Experience) for the Bloomberg Headquarters in Tokyo, NOX’s Son-O-House or Jason Bruges’s Memory Wall at the Puerta America Hotel. Since then I’ve begun to widen the focus to include interactive furniture, experimental projects at universities and research groups, and interesting new materials that I believe will transform how we apply technology into the built environment right down to nanotechnology such as the Buckymobile – Nano-Car. Scale is an enormously interesting facet of interactive architecture because increasingly this technology is becoming invisible to the naked eye. One guy at the moment whose work I really like is Usman Haque. His project Haunt has no visible technology but using humidity, temperature, electromagnetic and sonic frequencies that parapsychologists have associated with haunted spaces, he’s attempting to make a very powerful experience within what seems an unexceptional space. As a whole I find projects that suggest a future where integration of digital systems into the fabric of the built environment, rather than having computers as distinct objects embody what interactive architecture is about. Hopefully this will enable people to move around and interact with computers more naturally than they currently do.\n\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc07.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc08.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc09.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Following your experiences regularly writing about and viewing Interactive Architecture, Do you now think that, despite its flexible nature, Interactive Architecture now has a defined aesthetic? Do you think it can be compared to previous, more traditional movements in architecture?</strong>\n\nI don’t think that there is a particular aesthetic however it’s often the case that especially with low budget works that similar inputs such as camera tracking, an array of simple sensors and similar outputs such as data projectors, speakers, lighting etc are used. Also it is often the case that the software used is limited to high level languages shockwave, Max/MSP, etc. since most artists aren’t advanced coders so output can be limited. Having said this even within the limited number of input, processing and output tools I’ve named, there are virtually infinite combinations of outcomes to explore. Sure sometimes you can look at the aesthetic of a piece of work and say ‘Oh yes, that was done with that program’, and then a work starts to place itself aesthetically with a piece of software which is a shame. Professor Stephen Gage who runs the "Interactive Architecture Workshop" at the Bartlett School of Architecture, uses the word "Magic" as an aspiration. Interactive architecture should always aim to separate itself from its origins in a piece of software or other technology because when it’s impossible to work out exactly how something is happening, that’s where the magic comes in, that’s when the a project really ignites an exciting response.\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: We frequently hear of cyberspace, hyperspace, Virtual reality, hyperflexible space etc. All these terms (and more) fit within the sphere of interactive architecture. What is your opinion of this diversity? Is it a strength? A weakness?</strong>\n\nNone of these terms were coined specifically for interactive architecture. Terms like virtual reality, cyberspace, hypersurfaces etc. work as concepts within many facets of the arts in exploring the ‘digital age’. Interactive architecture actually resists strictly virtual or physical definitions. Instead it acts on the constantly shifting boundary between the two. Architects dECOi for example use the analogy of Liquid Crystal Displays which have a Smectic state which is the point at which a crystal is neatly ordered as a solid but exhibits fluid like flow. Marcos Novak uses the term Liquid Architecture while others go as far as to describe this flexible space as being energized to the point of being more like a gas. Personally practice drives my investigation and theory underpins it. My real heroes in Architecture are the guys who attempt to deal with the idea\ns of this unstable space by engaging with it in the built environment.\n\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc10.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc11.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc12.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you describe for us 3 of your favourite / most interesting / most inspirational works and tell us how they affected your working practice, or perceptions of interactive architecture?</strong>\n\nMy work deals most with interactive physically reconfiguring architecture. Not many people tend to explore this particular facet of interactive architecture partly because of the complications that crop up working with moving parts and flexible materials but mainly because it can be extremely expensive. I’ve had to use appropriated technology like car window motors for example instead of pistons for actuators for my Reciprocal Space project. Unfortunately there’s a pay off with performance. Not every one can afford to use 900+ pistons like architects dECOi did for the Aegis Hyposurface. Tobi Schneidler’s RemoteHome was a piece that inspired me because it treated physical movement in a very personal way and suggested how we could communicate with each other through tele-presence in a subtle non-explicit way by embedding actuators into the furniture and walls of our homes. The guy who’s pushing interactive moving architecture most at the moment is Kas Oosterhuis who runs the ‘Hyperbody Research Group’ at Delft. His ideas speculate that eventually we will be able to build entire buildings capable of changing in form with flexible hypersurface skins. None of his built pieces quite match up to his virtual representations but I really respect his passion to actualize these ideas into physical pieces of architecture. The guy who’s not recognized enough is Cedric Price who was the first person to see the potential in interactivity combining with reconfigurable architecture. His ‘Fun Palace’ 1960, which was an enormous flexible environment for infinite possible events to occur in. Aesthetically it looks like a factory but was designed for the public to play around and engage with the architecture. "Choose what you want to do – or watch someone else doing it. Learn how to handle tools, paint, babies, machinery, or just listen to your favourite tune. Dance, talk or be lifted up to where you can see how other people make things work. Sit out over space with a drink and tune in to what’s happening elsewhere in the city. Try starting a riot or beginning a painting – or just lie back and stare at the sky." Cedric Price speaking about the Fun Palace. He was light years ahead of its time and influenced the work of contemporary architects from Richard Rogers and Rem Koolhaas, to Rachel Whiteread. He was also the first to experiment with buildings having their own artificial intelligence and emotional states and how this would influence reconfigurable architecture.\n\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc13.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc14.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc15.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: How do you create the architecture of experience?</strong>\n\nAll architecture is experience, we create it for ourselves in how we move. <strong></strong>\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you tell us about interactivity within architecture, especially with regard to your own work. Would your pieces have "worked" without interactivity? Would they have "worked" without architecture?</strong>\n\nThe most important aim for me is to build immersive environments that question the widely held notion that architecture is fixed. In reality architecture is in constant flux as people, the environment and now digital information flows in, out and around these built environments. I express this with kinetic responses but many others have used a whole array of visual, tactile and audio effects. I’ve been experimenting for some time now with using Bio-Feedback mechanisms to make these spaces as immersive as possible. If the response to your interaction is sent back to you in real time your bond with the space is increased, the space starts to work at your biological and psychological level of cognition. Interactivity is necessary to give intelligence to this process so that the feedback loop that occurs does not become predictable but instead grows in complexity as your experience of the space does. My work is always intended to inhabit an existing space and then create its own or augment the spatial experience of that architecture.\n\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc16.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc17.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc18.jpg" alt="" width="148" /> <strong></strong>\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: What projects are you currently working on, or hoping to work on in the near future?</strong>\n\nI’m designing my first full scale building with Paul Burres who’s a traditionally trained Architect. It’s an extremely interesting process. It’s a speculative project based on creating physical spaces which you then build immaterial spaces within that can reconfigure in real time as the inhabitants converse and move around. Interactive architecture is always cross-disciplinary and it’s rare if not unheard of for someone to create a project entirely on their own. Architecture as a melting pot between the arts and sciences has increasingly become a cross disciplinary platform for discussion and experimentation into our new ‘Digital Society’. That’s what makes it so exciting to be involved in. One day I’m speaking to a specialist on Laminar Air Flow, the next day an electronics engineer, the next day a composite rubber specialist and so on. Interactive reconfigurable kinetic architecture is my focus. My last project Reciprocal Space which was essentially a room where the walls changed shape in response to an inhabitants movements creating a performance much like two people dancing together. It’s a real challenge working with interactive physically reconfiguring space because of the lack of appropriate materials and technology available. Reciprocal Space was constructed out of 32 car window motors, hacked computer parts, sheets of latex and hundreds of meters of cabling. Hardly Hi-Tech but it worked although installing something like this for permanent installation into a building requires a great deal more rigor in terms of reliability and safety. When you begin to design for the built environment funny little things called building regulations begin to start to influence your practice, you have to start considering what happens in the event of a fire or a flood, and rightly so you have to make spaces that are accessible for people in wheelchairs and consider the safety of children. I don’t find these constraints limiting though, as its often when you start to put parameters within which you build these environments that you really begin to push yourself. As for the future, I’ve just started making a book without any digital technology in sight, just an experiment into how the book as a collection of 2D planes can create architectural experience using image, text, material, binding etc. I think it’s important to work on something small and delicate while you’re working on something monstrous like a building. It keeps you in touch with the 1:1 scale which you don’t get from drawing 1:100 scale plans and sections of buildings. <strong></strong>\n\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: What do you see is the future for Interactive Architecture?

It’s still seen by mainstream architects as a quirky add-on for those who can afford it. Until that changes it will be treated as novelty architecture like it was in the Millennium Dome. I think it’s beginning to get wider recognition as a valuable asset to the buildings where it has been used well and as the technology for these kinds of projects become cheaper, more powerful and importantly smaller to the point of becoming invisible I see it being embedded into wider mainstream architecture.

Interactive Architecture is an extension of that dealing at the cutting edge of digital technology.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc04.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc05.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc06.jpg" alt="" /> <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: You have been writing regularly on the subject of interactive architecture for many months now, but how do you categorise it? How do you decide what is interactive architecture and what is not?</strong>\r\n\r\ninteractivearchitecture.org has a life of its own. Initially when I started it was very focused reporting on what could be easily identified as interactive architecture, i.e. interactive installations for large scale architectural projects such as BIX, at the Kunsthaus Graz in Austria, Toshio Iwai’s ICE (Interactive Communicative Experience) for the Bloomberg Headquarters in Tokyo, NOX’s Son-O-House or Jason Bruges’s Memory Wall at the Puerta America Hotel. Since then I’ve begun to widen the focus to include interactive furniture, experimental projects at universities and research groups, and interesting new materials that I believe will transform how we apply technology into the built environment right down to nanotechnology such as the Buckymobile – Nano-Car. Scale is an enormously interesting facet of interactive architecture because increasingly this technology is becoming invisible to the naked eye. One guy at the moment whose work I really like is Usman Haque. His project Haunt has no visible technology but using humidity, temperature, electromagnetic and sonic frequencies that parapsychologists have associated with haunted spaces, he’s attempting to make a very powerful experience within what seems an unexceptional space. As a whole I find projects that suggest a future where integration of digital systems into the fabric of the built environment, rather than having computers as distinct objects embody what interactive architecture is about. Hopefully this will enable people to move around and interact with computers more naturally than they currently do.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc07.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc08.jpg" alt="" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/2005/hmc09.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Following your experiences regularly writing about and viewing Interactive Architecture, Do you now think that, despite its flexible nature, Interactive Architecture now has a defined aesthetic? Do you think it can be compared to previous, more traditional movements in architecture?</strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t think that there is a particular aesthetic however it’s often the case that especially with low budget works that similar inputs such as camera tracking, an array of simple sensors and similar outputs such as data projectors, speakers, lighting etc are used. Also it is often the case that the software used is limited to high level languages shockwave, Max/MSP, etc. since most artists aren’t advanced coders so output can be limited. Having said this even within the limited number of input, processing and output tools I’ve named, there are virtually infinite combinations of outcomes to explore. Sure sometimes you can look at the aesthetic of a piece of work and say ‘Oh yes, that was done with that program’, and then a work starts to place itself aesthetically with a piece of software which is a shame. Professor Stephen Gage who runs the "Interactive Architecture Workshop" at the Bartlett School of Architecture, uses the word "Magic" as an aspiration. Interactive architecture should always aim to separate itself from its origins in a piece of software or other technology because when it’s impossible to work out exactly how something is happening, that’s where the magic comes in, that’s when the a project really ignites an exciting response.\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: We frequently hear of cyberspace, hyperspace, Virtual reality, hyperflexible space etc. All these terms (and more) fit within the sphere of interactive architecture. What is your opinion of this diversity? Is it a strength? A weakness?</strong>\r\n\r\nNone of these terms were coined specifically for interactive architecture. Terms like virtual reality, cyberspace, hypersurfaces etc. work as concepts within many facets of the arts in exploring the ‘digital age’. Interactive architecture actually resists strictly virtual or physical definitions. Instead it acts on the constantly shifting boundary between the two. Architects dECOi for example use the analogy of Liquid Crystal Displays which have a Smectic state which is the point at which a crystal is neatly ordered as a solid but exhibits fluid like flow. Marcos Novak uses the term Liquid Architecture while others go as far as to describe this flexible space as being energized to the point of being more like a gas. Personally practice drives my investigation and theory underpins it. My real heroes in Architecture are the guys who attempt to deal with the idea\r\ns of this unstable space by engaging with it in the built environment.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc10.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc11.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc12.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you describe for us 3 of your favourite / most interesting / most inspirational works and tell us how they affected your working practice, or perceptions of interactive architecture?</strong>\r\n\r\nMy work deals most with interactive physically reconfiguring architecture. Not many people tend to explore this particular facet of interactive architecture partly because of the complications that crop up working with moving parts and flexible materials but mainly because it can be extremely expensive. I’ve had to use appropriated technology like car window motors for example instead of pistons for actuators for my Reciprocal Space project. Unfortunately there’s a pay off with performance. Not every one can afford to use 900+ pistons like architects dECOi did for the Aegis Hyposurface. Tobi Schneidler’s RemoteHome was a piece that inspired me because it treated physical movement in a very personal way and suggested how we could communicate with each other through tele-presence in a subtle non-explicit way by embedding actuators into the furniture and walls of our homes. The guy who’s pushing interactive moving architecture most at the moment is Kas Oosterhuis who runs the ‘Hyperbody Research Group’ at Delft. His ideas speculate that eventually we will be able to build entire buildings capable of changing in form with flexible hypersurface skins. None of his built pieces quite match up to his virtual representations but I really respect his passion to actualize these ideas into physical pieces of architecture. The guy who’s not recognized enough is Cedric Price who was the first person to see the potential in interactivity combining with reconfigurable architecture. His ‘Fun Palace’ 1960, which was an enormous flexible environment for infinite possible events to occur in. Aesthetically it looks like a factory but was designed for the public to play around and engage with the architecture. "Choose what you want to do – or watch someone else doing it. Learn how to handle tools, paint, babies, machinery, or just listen to your favourite tune. Dance, talk or be lifted up to where you can see how other people make things work. Sit out over space with a drink and tune in to what’s happening elsewhere in the city. Try starting a riot or beginning a painting – or just lie back and stare at the sky." Cedric Price speaking about the Fun Palace. He was light years ahead of its time and influenced the work of contemporary architects from Richard Rogers and Rem Koolhaas, to Rachel Whiteread. He was also the first to experiment with buildings having their own artificial intelligence and emotional states and how this would influence reconfigurable architecture.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc13.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc14.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc15.jpg" alt="" width="148" />\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: How do you create the architecture of experience?</strong>\r\n\r\nAll architecture is experience, we create it for ourselves in how we move. <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you tell us about interactivity within architecture, especially with regard to your own work. Would your pieces have "worked" without interactivity? Would they have "worked" without architecture?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe most important aim for me is to build immersive environments that question the widely held notion that architecture is fixed. In reality architecture is in constant flux as people, the environment and now digital information flows in, out and around these built environments. I express this with kinetic responses but many others have used a whole array of visual, tactile and audio effects. I’ve been experimenting for some time now with using Bio-Feedback mechanisms to make these spaces as immersive as possible. If the response to your interaction is sent back to you in real time your bond with the space is increased, the space starts to work at your biological and psychological level of cognition. Interactivity is necessary to give intelligence to this process so that the feedback loop that occurs does not become predictable but instead grows in complexity as your experience of the space does. My work is always intended to inhabit an existing space and then create its own or augment the spatial experience of that architecture.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc16.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc17.jpg" alt="" width="148" /><img src="http://ia.local/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc18.jpg" alt="" width="148" /> <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: What projects are you currently working on, or hoping to work on in the near future?</strong>\r\n\r\nI’m designing my first full scale building with Paul Burres who’s a traditionally trained Architect. It’s an extremely interesting process. It’s a speculative project based on creating physical spaces which you then build immaterial spaces within that can reconfigure in real time as the inhabitants converse and move around. Interactive architecture is always cross-disciplinary and it’s rare if not unheard of for someone to create a project entirely on their own. Architecture as a melting pot between the arts and sciences has increasingly become a cross disciplinary platform for discussion and experimentation into our new ‘Digital Society’. That’s what makes it so exciting to be involved in. One day I’m speaking to a specialist on Laminar Air Flow, the next day an electronics engineer, the next day a composite rubber specialist and so on. Interactive reconfigurable kinetic architecture is my focus. My last project Reciprocal Space which was essentially a room where the walls changed shape in response to an inhabitants movements creating a performance much like two people dancing together. It’s a real challenge working with interactive physically reconfiguring space because of the lack of appropriate materials and technology available. Reciprocal Space was constructed out of 32 car window motors, hacked computer parts, sheets of latex and hundreds of meters of cabling. Hardly Hi-Tech but it worked although installing something like this for permanent installation into a building requires a great deal more rigor in terms of reliability and safety. When you begin to design for the built environment funny little things called building regulations begin to start to influence your practice, you have to start considering what happens in the event of a fire or a flood, and rightly so you have to make spaces that are accessible for people in wheelchairs and consider the safety of children. I don’t find these constraints limiting though, as its often when you start to put parameters within which you build these environments that you really begin to push yourself. As for the future, I’ve just started making a book without any digital technology in sight, just an experiment into how the book as a collection of 2D planes can create architectural experience using image, text, material, binding etc. I think it’s important to work on something small and delicate while you’re working on something monstrous like a building. It keeps you in touch with the 1:1 scale which you don’t get from drawing 1:100 scale plans and sections of buildings. <strong></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: What do you see is the future for Interactive Architecture? You mention on your site that it is flexible and semi-permanent. Because of this transient sensibility will Interactive Architecture perhaps not be aro\r\nund for too long?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo far from it. It’s still seen by mainstream architects as a quirky add-on for those who can afford it. Until that changes it will be treated as novelty architecture like it was in the Millennium Dome. I think it’s beginning to get wider recognition as a valuable asset to the buildings where it has been used well and as the technology for these kinds of projects become cheaper, more powerful and importantly smaller to the point of becoming invisible I see it being embedded into wider mainstream architecture. The problem is making architects realize that you can do more with intelligent architecture than just control heating, airflow, and security systems. When I talk about it as semi-permanent I’m saying that it would arrogant and short sighted of any interactive architect to believe he can design an interactive installation that will have a fixed function for the same lifetime as a building. Simply because buildings last a long time and in their lifetimes their uses change. Technology and the way people use it changes too and so I believe good Interactive Architecture does one of two things. It either accepts its place in time and serves a function for that period and then either is replaced or it is kept as a historical artifact or it is an open system capable of change so as to adapt to the changing role of the fixed architecture it inhabits. Its important to recognize however that while technological obsolescence can almost be charted on a graph, the cultural obsolescence of existing and future examples of Interactive Architecture are much harder to predict. I hope the BIX is still running in 50 or a 100 years time even though it is already out of date in respect to the available technologies that can be used to build its hypersurfaces. I hope at the same time though that interactive architects can come up with more open systems capable of lasting or even exceeding the lifetime of the physical spaces they are initially built within.', '', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '1394-revision-2', '', '', '2012-04-15 19:22:40', '2012-04-15 19:22:40', '', 1394, 'http://ia.local/1394-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Then in 2000, I visited the Millennium Dome with all its interactive "Zones", I know it was given a lot of bad press but I loved the idea that there was an industry somewhere out there where people built interactive spaces. Yeah a lot of it lacked real content and the whole thing was a big failure but I just thought to myself, hey this is much cooler than making stuff that just appears on screen. Pretty unsure about how I could getting involved with this new interest, I chose to give up my place at the Bartlett School of Architecture which at degree level didn’t go into the depth I wanted in terms of digital media. I chose instead to go to MediaLab Arts (now re-branded Digital Arts and Technology) in Plymouth because the relationship between digital media and space was a major part of their research although the education wasn’t specifically architectural. The skills I learnt in HCI, programming, and design have transferred over seamlessly when I then spent my final year synthesizing this within an architectural framework. I’m now at the Bartlett working with architects on how to bring this all forward. Having come from a sculpture background originally I’ve enjoyed getting my hands dirty again.\r\n\r\n<strong>HMC MediaLab: Is all architecture interactive?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo. Is a block of concrete interactive? I don’t think so, is a door or window interactive? Well no, there’s no intelligence in its activity. I once got told a story about how the Greater London Council some years ago banned the use of Polycarbonate as a façade material because some stupid kid got a brick and threw it at a see-through polycarbonate façade thinking it was glass. Of course the polycarbonate didn’t break, in fact the brick bounced straight back and cracked the kid in the head. Now no question the kid deserved it but the building didn’t make a valued judgment on whether the kid deserved the punishment.

Or read the Interview further below between HMC MediaLab & Myself (November 2005)\n\n\n<div align="center"><h4>part 1</h4>\n<object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kxkHWD311NA&hl=en&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kxkHWD311NA&hl=en&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object>\n\n<h4>part 2</h4>\n<object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PUKpLyVVyok&hl=en&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PUKpLyVVyok&hl=en&rel=0&color1=0x5d1719&color2=0xcd311b&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interview</h2>\n\n<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc01.jpg" width="149" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc02.jpg" width="149" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc03.jpg" width="149" /> <br /><br /><strong>HMC MediaLab: Ruairi, How did you first become interested in Interactive Architecture?</strong> <br /><br />I''ve always been interested in architecture and saw myself designing buildings one day but I got lured away by the beautiful work of guys like Daniel Brown''s Noodlebox, and everything Hi-ReS were doing and began studying multimedia. Then in 2000, I visited the Millennium Dome with all its interactive &quot;Zones&quot;, I know it was given a lot of bad press but I loved the idea that there was an industry somewhere out there where people built interactive spaces. Yeah a lot of it lacked real content and the whole thing was a big failure but I just thought to myself, hey this is much cooler than making stuff that just appears on screen.  Pretty unsure about how I could getting involved with this new interest, I chose to give up my place at the Bartlett School of Architecture which at degree level didn''t go into the depth I wanted in terms of digital media. I chose instead to go to MediaLab Arts (now re-branded Digital Arts and Technology) in Plymouth because the relationship between digital media and space was a major part of their research although the education wasn''t specifically architectural. The skills I learnt in HCI, programming, and design have transferred over seamlessly when I then spent my final year synthesizing this within an architectural framework. I''m now at the Bartlett working with architects on how to bring this all forward. Having come from a sculpture background originally I''ve enjoyed getting my hands dirty again.<br /><br />&nbsp;<strong>HMC MediaLab: Is all architecture interactive?</strong> <br /><br />No. Is a block of concrete interactive? I don''t think so, is a door or window interactive? Well no, there''s no intelligence in its activity. I once got told a story about how the Greater London Council some years ago banned the use of Polycarbonate as a fa&ccedil;ade material because some stupid kid got a brick and threw it at a see-through polycarbonate fa&ccedil;ade thinking it was glass. Of course the polycarbonate didn''t break, in fact the brick bounced straight back and cracked the kid in the head. Now no question the kid deserved it but the building didn''t make a valued judgment on whether the kid deserved the punishment. Interactive Architecture, for me is about the potential for digital systems to make decisions about our living environment and then influence that environment. Architecture as a whole discipline should aim to improve the environments we live and work in. Interactive Architecture is an extension of that dealing at the cutting edge of digital technology. <br /><br /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc04.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc05.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc06.jpg" width="148" /> <strong><br /><br />HMC MediaLab: You have been writing regularly on the subject of interactive architecture for many months now, but how do you categorise it? How do you decide what is interactive architecture and what is not?</strong><br /><br />&nbsp;interactivearchitecture.org has a life of its own. Initially when I started it was very focused reporting on what could be easily identified as interactive architecture, i.e. interactive installations for large scale architectural projects such as BIX, at the Kunsthaus Graz in Austria, Toshio Iwai''s ICE (Interactive Communicative Experience) for the Bloomberg Headquarters in Tokyo, NOX''s Son-O-House or Jason Bruges''s Memory Wall at the Puerta America Hotel. Since then I''ve begun to widen the focus to include interactive furniture, experimental projects at universities and research groups, and interesting new materials that I believe will transform how we apply technology into the built environment right down to nanotechnology such as the Buckymobile - Nano-Car.  Scale is an enormously interesting facet of interactive architecture because increasingly this technology is becoming invisible to the naked eye. One guy at the moment whose work I really like is Usman Haque. His project Haunt has no visible technology but using humidity, temperature, electromagnetic and sonic frequencies that parapsychologists have associated with haunted spaces, he''s attempting to make a very powerful experience within what seems an unexceptional space. As a whole I find projects that suggest a future where integration of digital systems into the fabric of the built environment, rather than having computers as distinct objects embody what interactive architecture is about. Hopefully this will enable people to move around and interact with computers more naturally than they currently do.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc07.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc08.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc09.jpg" width="148" /> <br /><br /><strong>HMC MediaLab: Following your experiences regularly writing about and viewing Interactive Architecture, Do you now think that, despite its flexible nature, Interactive Architecture now has a defined aesthetic? Do you think it can be compared to previous, more traditional movements in architecture?</strong> <br /><br />I don''t think that there is a particular aesthetic however it''s often the case that especially with low budget works that similar inputs such as camera tracking, an array of simple sensors and similar outputs such as data projectors, speakers, lighting etc are used. Also it is often the case that the software used is limited to high level languages shockwave, Max/MSP, etc. since most artists aren''t advanced coders so output can be limited. Having said this even within the limited number of input, processing and output tools I''ve named, there are virtually infinite combinations of outcomes to explore.  Sure sometimes you can look at the aesthetic of a piece of work and say ''Oh yes, that was done with that program'', and then a work starts to place itself aesthetically with a piece of software which is a shame. Professor Stephen Gage who runs the &quot;Interactive Architecture Workshop&quot; at the Bartlett School of Architecture, uses the word &quot;Magic&quot; as an aspiration. Interactive architecture should always aim to separate itself from its origins in a piece of software or other technology because when it''s impossible to work out exactly how something is happening, that''s where the magic comes in, that''s when the a project really ignites an exciting response. <br /><br /><strong>HMC MediaLab: We frequently hear of cyberspace, hyperspace, Virtual reality, hyperflexible space etc. All these terms (and more) fit within the sphere of interactive architecture. What is your opinion of this diversity? Is it a strength? A weakness?</strong> <br /><br />None of these terms were coined specifically for interactive architecture. Terms like virtual reality, cyberspace, hypersurfaces etc. work as concepts within many facets of the arts in exploring the ''digital age''. Interactive architecture actually resists strictly virtual or physical definitions. Instead it acts on the constantly shifting boundary between the two. Architects dECOi for example use the analogy of Liquid Crystal Displays which have a Smectic state which is the point at which a crystal is neatly ordered as a solid but exhibits fluid like flow. Marcos Novak uses the term Liquid Architecture while others go as far as to describe this flexible space as being energized to the point of being more like a gas. Personally practice drives my investigation and theory underpins it. My real heroes in Architecture are the guys who attempt to deal with the idea\ns of this unstable space by engaging with it in the built environment.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc10.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc11.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc12.jpg" width="148" /> <br /><br /><strong>HMC MediaLab: Could you describe for us 3 of your favourite / most interesting / most inspirational works and tell us how they affected your working practice, or perceptions of interactive architecture?</strong> <br /><br />My work deals most with interactive physically reconfiguring architecture. Not many people tend to explore this particular facet of interactive architecture partly because of the complications that crop up working with moving parts and flexible materials but mainly because it can be extremely expensive. I''ve had to use appropriated technology like car window motors for example instead of pistons for actuators for my Reciprocal Space project. Unfortunately there''s a pay off with performance. Not every one can afford to use 900+ pistons like architects dECOi did for the Aegis Hyposurface.  Tobi Schneidler''s RemoteHome was a piece that inspired me because it treated physical movement in a very personal way and suggested how we could communicate with each other through tele-presence in a subtle non-explicit way by embedding actuators into the furniture and walls of our homes.  The guy who''s pushing interactive moving architecture most at the moment is Kas Oosterhuis who runs the ''Hyperbody Research Group'' at Delft. His ideas speculate that eventually we will be able to build entire buildings capable of changing in form with flexible hypersurface skins. None of his built pieces quite match up to his virtual representations but I really respect his passion to actualize these ideas into physical pieces of architecture.  The guy who''s not recognized enough is Cedric Price who was the first person to see the potential in interactivity combining with reconfigurable architecture. His ''Fun Palace'' 1960, which was an enormous flexible environment for infinite possible events to occur in. Aesthetically it looks like a factory but was designed for the public to play around and engage with the architecture.  &quot;Choose what you want to do - or watch someone else doing it. Learn how to handle tools, paint, babies, machinery, or just listen to your favourite tune. Dance, talk or be lifted up to where you can see how other people make things work. Sit out over space with a drink and tune in to what''s happening elsewhere in the city. Try starting a riot or beginning a painting - or just lie back and stare at the sky.&quot; Cedric Price speaking about the Fun Palace.  He was light years ahead of its time and influenced the work of contemporary architects from Richard Rogers and Rem Koolhaas, to Rachel Whiteread. He was also the first to experiment with buildings having their own artificial intelligence and emotional states and how this would influence reconfigurable architecture.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc13.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc14.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc15.jpg" width="148" /> <br /><br /><strong>HMC MediaLab: How do you create the architecture of experience?</strong> <br /><br />All architecture is experience, we create it for ourselves in how we move. <strong><br /><br />HMC MediaLab: Could you tell us about interactivity within architecture, especially with regard to your own work. Would your pieces have &quot;worked&quot; without interactivity? Would they have &quot;worked&quot; without architecture?</strong> <br /><br />The most important aim for me is to build immersive environments that question the widely held notion that architecture is fixed. In reality architecture is in constant flux as people, the environment and now digital information flows in, out and around these built environments. I express this with kinetic responses but many others have used a whole array of visual, tactile and audio effects.  I''ve been experimenting for some time now with using Bio-Feedback mechanisms to make these spaces as immersive as possible. If the response to your interaction is sent back to you in real time your bond with the space is increased, the space starts to work at your biological and psychological level of cognition.  Interactivity is necessary to give intelligence to this process so that the feedback loop that occurs does not become predictable but instead grows in complexity as your experience of the space does. My work is always intended to inhabit an existing space and then create its own or augment the spatial experience of that architecture.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc16.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc17.jpg" width="148" /><img src="/assets/wp-content/imagebank/hmc18.jpg" width="148" /> <strong><br /><br />HMC MediaLab: What projects are you currently working on, or hoping to work on in the near future?</strong> <br /><br />I''m designing my first full scale building with Paul Burres who''s a traditionally trained Architect. It''s an extremely interesting process. It''s a speculative project based on creating physical spaces which you then build immaterial spaces within that can reconfigure in real time as the inhabitants converse and move around. Interactive architecture is always cross-disciplinary and it''s rare if not unheard of for someone to create a project entirely on their own. Architecture as a melting pot between the arts and sciences has increasingly become a cross disciplinary platform for discussion and experimentation into our new ''Digital Society''. That''s what makes it so exciting to be involved in. One day I''m speaking to a specialist on Laminar Air Flow, the next day an electronics engineer, the next day a composite rubber specialist and so on.  Interactive reconfigurable kinetic architecture is my focus. My last project Reciprocal Space which was essentially a room where the walls changed shape in response to an inhabitants movements creating a performance much like two people dancing together.  It''s a real challenge working with interactive physically reconfiguring space because of the lack of appropriate materials and technology available. Reciprocal Space was constructed out of 32 car window motors, hacked computer parts, sheets of latex and hundreds of meters of cabling. Hardly Hi-Tech but it worked although installing something like this for permanent installation into a building requires a great deal more rigor in terms of reliability and safety. When you begin to design for the built environment funny little things called building regulations begin to start to influence your practice, you have to start considering what happens in the event of a fire or a flood, and rightly so you have to make spaces that are accessible for people in wheelchairs and consider the safety of children. I don''t find these constraints limiting though, as its often when you start to put parameters within which you build these environments that you really begin to push yourself.  As for the future, I''ve just started making a book without any digital technology in sight, just an experiment into how the book as a collection of 2D planes can create architectural experience using image, text, material, binding etc. I think it''s important to work on something small and delicate while you''re working on something monstrous like a building. It keeps you in touch with the 1:1 scale which you don''t get from drawing 1:100 scale plans and sections of buildings. <strong><br /><br />HMC MediaLab: What do you see is the future for Interactive Architecture? You mention on your site that it is flexible and semi-permanent. Because of this transient sensibility will Interactive Architecture perhaps not be aro\nund for too long?</strong> <br /><br />No far from it. It''s still seen by mainstream architects as a quirky add-on for those who can afford it. Until that changes it will be treated as novelty architecture like it was in the Millennium Dome. I think it''s beginning to get wider recognition as a valuable asset to the buildings where it has been used well and as the technology for these kinds of projects become cheaper, more powerful and importantly smaller to the point of becoming invisible I see it being embedded into wider mainstream architecture. The problem is making architects realize that you can do more with intelligent architecture than just control heating, airflow, and security systems.  When I talk about it as semi-permanent I''m saying that it would arrogant and short sighted of any interactive architect to believe he can design an interactive installation that will have a fixed function for the same lifetime as a building. Simply because buildings last a long time and in their lifetimes their uses change. Technology and the way people use it changes too and so I believe good Interactive Architecture does one of two things.  It either accepts its place in time and serves a function for that period and then either is replaced or it is kept as a historical artifact or it is an open system capable of change so as to adapt to the changing role of the fixed architecture it inhabits. Its important to recognize however that while technological obsolescence can almost be charted on a graph, the cultural obsolescence of existing and future examples of Interactive Architecture are much harder to predict.  I hope the BIX is still running in 50 or a 100 years time even though it is already out of date in respect to the available technologies that can be used to build its hypersurfaces. I hope at the same time though that interactive architects can come up with more open systems capable of lasting or even exceeding the lifetime of the physical spaces they are initially built within.', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '22-revision', '', '', '2005-09-14 17:21:29', '2005-09-14 16:21:29', '', 22, 'http://ia.local/22-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
